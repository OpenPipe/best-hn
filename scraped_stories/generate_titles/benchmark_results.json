Apart from a major source of the world\u2019s crude oil and petroleum exports, countries from Mideast have also earned accolades for a hub for successful startups.\nThe transcontinental region in the western part of the Asia joins the club of innovation with royal countries like Saudi Arabia, tech hub like Israel \u2013 with more than 3,000 high-tech companies and startups \u2013 and Turkey.\nTo get a clearer picture of participation of Mideast countries in innovation in the USA, we studied their patent filing activities \u2013 one patent per family \u2013 with the USPTO.\u00a0 Our study revealed that, in the last 5 years, companies based out at Mideast have filed more than 20k patents at the USPTO.\nIn this post, we have provided you the top five Mideast countries filing patents with the USPTO. Other than that, you will also know the top three assignees from these countries.\nBut how all this helps me, you ask? The article will be of your interest if you are \u2013\n\nA US attorney who wants to extend his services to clients outside the US.\nAn investor who always looks for interesting technologies for investment or licensing.\nA company looking for licensing with institutes from the Mideast to modify its products/technologies.\nA University looking for other partners working in a similar space.\n\nSo we can say that the analysis serves a range, that is, from a company who wants to set up its R&D facility in the Mideast, to an investor who is interested in finding emerging technologies in a specific country in the Mideast. Moreover, in upcoming posts of the series, we will let you know the top three technologies popular in these countries and the law firms or independent attorneys involved in patent filing.\nTop Five Countries from Mideast Pushing the Innovation Envelope\nThe graph below gives the top ten countries from the Mideast that filed maximum number of patents with the USPTO in the last five years.\n\nIsrael\nIsrael, which is ranked #13 in term of scientific research tops the list with more than 15,000 patents. This isn\u2019t surprising at all as it spends a large part of its GDP \u2013 4.2% in 2012 \u2013 on research and development.\nThe top industries comprising the innovation there are related to technological and biomedical equipments.\nTop Three Assignees of Israel filing Patents at the USPTO\nThe graph below provides the top assignees in Israel with their patent counts.\n\n\nRamot at Tel-Aviv University, with 298 patents, is the top assignee from Israel filing patents with the USPTO. Founded in 1973, the university is responsible for major innovations in Electronics, Defense and security, and biotechnology sectors.\nYeda Research and Development, a company founded in 1959, is the second top assignee from Israel. The company is based on R&D and identifies the project with commercial potential.\nYissum Research Development, a technology transfer company of the Hebrew University, sits in the #3 positions. It is focused on marketing and licensing the products that are developed by university researchers.\n\nTurkey\nTurkey with more than 3000 patents filed with USPTO sits in #2 positions. Steel production, agriculture and automotive industries are areas where Turkey spends most of its R&D funds.\nTop Three Assignees of Turkey filing Patents at the USPTO\n\nThe above graph is of the top assignee in Turkey with their patent counts.\n\nThe top assignee in turkey is Arcelik Anonim Sirketi; the company was founded in 1955 and is known for consumer electronics and home appliances.\nThe 2nd top assignee is Bilgic Mahmut with 124 patents. Most of the patents filed by this company are based on pharmaceutical products.\nThe 3rd top assignee is Vestel Beyaz Esya Sanayi Ve Ticaret AS, founded in 1997. Just like Arcelik Anonim Sirketi, Vestel Beyaz is also involved in production of home appliances like refrigerator, washing machines and air conditioners.\n\nSaudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is the #3 country that has filed over 2000 patents in past five years with the USPTO. Saudi Arabian economy survives on oil and petrochemical production, which account for 92.5% of their total budget revenue. Needles to say, the research there is also focused on oil field technologies.\nTop Three Assignees of Saudi Arabia filing Patents at the USPTO\n\nThe graph above shows the patent distribution by assignees in Saudi Arabia. As we discussed earlier, the economy of Saudi Arabia is based on oil production and exports, the major assignees of countries are from the oil field domain.\n\nSaudi Aramco, founded in 1933, is on the top of the list. It was known as Arabian American Oil Company before it changed its name in 1988. As the name says, Saudi Aramco is a major oil company in Saudi Arabia.\nThe Second top assignee is King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals which was established in 1963 and has filed 398 patents in the past 5 years.\nThe third top company is Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, establish in 1976. The company is based on Petrochemicals and other petroleum products.\n\nThe UAE\nThe United Arab Emirates in among the most digitalized and advanced countries with minimum paperwork, says the World Bank. And by filing over 508 patents in past 5 years, at the USPTO, helps UAE to clinch the fourth spot.\nTop Three Assignees of The UAE filing Patents in the USPTO\n\n\nThe above graph reveals that any assignee in the UAE doesn\u2019t outrank other by a large margin. If we take the top five among them, you will find that the top 2 and last two assignees have filed the same number of patent applications. Moreover, Eida Al Muhairbi, at #5, is an independent inventor.\nBelow is a brief detail of the top three among them.\n\nEmirates Telecommunications Corporation is #1 assignee from the UAE filing patents with the USPTO. The company provides the telecommunication and media services.\nThe second one is Khalifa University of Science and Technology & Research and was founded in 2007. In 2014, it was ranked the top 441st best university in the world.\nThe 3rd top assignee is British Telecommunications, founded in 1984. They also provide the telecommunication services worldwide.\n\nCyprus\nThe 5th ranked country in the Mideast is Cyprus. It filed 505 patents in the past 5 years, only 3 less than the UAE. Unlike Israel and Saudi Arabia, research and development isn\u2019t a hot topic in Cyprus as it spends 0.4% \u2013 0.5% of their GDP on it.\nIt was a little intro about the countries with their patent filing rate and R&D spending. Now we will see the top innovator in between each of them.\nTop Three Assignees of Cyprus filing Patents at the USPTO\n\nLike the UAE, patent filing activities in Cyprus are low and there is hardly any large gap in the patent filed by different assignees there. The top three assignees from Cyprus are as follows:\n\nThe top assignee is Scambia Holdings Cyprus with 25 patent applications. The company is based on intellectual property licensing.\nThe second top is Bitdefender IPR Management with 21 patents. Just like the top assignee, this company is based on Intellectual property rights management.\nThe third with 16 patents is Mobileye Technologies. The company is based on software/algorithms and manufactures integrated computer products for automobile industries i.e. DAS.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "original_score": 1,
    "rm_score_original": 1.609375,
    "scraped_body": "\n        \n        We\u2019ve been using the Kotlin programming language for a few weeks on our latest project to perform technical experiments, explore the problem space, and write a few HTTP services. I\u2019ve also ported Hamcrest to Kotlin, as HamKrest, to help us write tests, and written a small library for type safe configuration of our services.\n        \nWhy Kotlin?\nThe organisation I\u2019m working with has mature infrastructure for deploying JVM services in their internal PaaS cloud. They use a mix of Java and Scala but have found Scala builds too slow. Watching my colleague struggle to use Java 8 streams to write what should have been basic functional map-and-fold code, I decided to have a look at some other \u201cpost-Java\u201d JVM languages.\nWe wanted a typed language. We wanted language aware editing. And we wanted a language that had an organisation behind its development and enough people using it that we could get questions answered, even the stupid ones we\u2019d be likely to ask while learning.\nThat eliminated dynamically typed languages (Groovy, JavaScript, Clojure) and languages that are less popular or have small, informal development teams behind them (Xtend, Gosu, Fantom, Frege, etc.). In the end it came down to Red Hat\u2019s Ceylon and JetBrains\u2019 Kotlin. Of the two, Ceylon is the most innovative, and therefore (to me, anyway) the most interesting, but Kotlin met more of our criteria. Kotlin has a more active community, is being used for commercial development by JetBrains and a number of other companies1, has good editing support within IntelliJ, has an active community on social media, and promises easy interop with existing Java libraries.\n\n        \nGood points\nKotlin was very quick to learn. Kotlin is a conservative increment to Java that smooths off a lot of Java\u2019s rough edges. Kotlin is small and regular, with few special cases and gotchas to learn. In many ways it feels a bit like a compiled, typed Python with curly brace syntax.\nThe type system is a breath of fresh air compared to Java. Type inferencing makes code less cluttered. There is no distinction between primitive & reference types. Generics and subtyping work together far better than Java: the type system uses declaration site variance, not use site variance, and variance does not usually have to be specified at all for functions. You never have unavoidable compiler warnings, as you do with Java\u2019s type system.\nFunctional programming is more convenient in Kotlin than Java. You can define free-standing functions and constants at the top level of a module, instead of having to define them in a \u201cUtils\u201d class. Function definitions can be nested. There is language support for immutable value types (aka \u201cdata classes\u201d) and algebraic data types (\u201csealed classes\u201d). Null safety is enforced by the type system and variables and fields are non-nullable by default. The language defines standard function types and a lambda syntax for anonymous functions.\nYou can define extension methods on existing types. They are only syntactic sugar for free-standing functions, but nevertheless can lead to more concise, expressive code. The Kotlin standard library defines a number of useful extension methods, especially on the Iterable and String types.\nKotlin supports, and carefully controls, operator overloading. You can overload operators that act as functions (e.g.\u00a0arithmetic, comparison, function call) but not those that perform flow control (e.g.\u00a0short-cut logical operators). You cannot define your own operators, which will stop me going down the rabbit hole of \u201cascii-art programming\u201d, which I found hard to resist when writing Scala.\nClass definitions require a lot less boilerplate than in Java. Using old fashioned getter-and-setter style Java code is made more convenient by language support for bean properties.\nAnonymous extension methods (borrowed from Groovy, I believe) make domain specific embedded languages easier to write. Method chaining builder APIs are unnecessary in Kotlin and more awkward than using the apply function to set properties of an object.\nKotlin has a philosophy of preferring behaviour to be explicitly specified. For example, there is no automatic coercion between numeric types, even from low to high precision. That means you have to explicitly convert from Int to Long, for example. I like that, but I expect some people will find it annoying.\n\n        \nSurprises\n\nI didn\u2019t miss destructuring pattern match\nKotlin doesn\u2019t have destructuring pattern match & language support for tuples. A limited form of destructuring can be used in for loops and assignments. The when expression is an alternative conditional expression that doesn\u2019t do destructuring.\nI was surprised to find that I didn\u2019t really miss destructuring. Without tuples you have to use data classes with named fields. The flow-sensitive typing then works rather well where destructuring would be necessary in a language where the type system is not flow-sensitive. For example:\nsealed class Result<out T> {\n   class Success<T>(val value: T) : Result<T>()\n   class Failure(val exception: Throwable): Result<Any>()\n}\n\n...\n\nval e : Result<String> = doSomething()\nif (e is Result.Success<String>) {\n    // e is known to be a Result.Success<String> and\n    // can be used as such without a downcast\n    println(e.value)\n}\n\n\nSealed classes cannot be data classes\nAn algebraic data type cannot be be a data class, so you have to write equals, hashCode, etc. yourself. This is a surprising omission, since I always want an algebraic data type to be a value type. The Kotlin developers say that this will be fixed after version 1.0 is released.\n\n\nFunctions are not quite first-class objects\nThere\u2019s a difference between f1 and f2 below:\nval f1 = {i:Int -> i+1}\nfun f2(i:Int) = i + 1\nCode can refer to the value of f1 directly, but must use the \u201c::\u201d operator to obtain a reference to f2:\nval f = ::f2\n\n\nNull safe operators push me to write more extension functions\nThe null safe operators (?. and ?:) only help when dereferencing a nullable reference. When you have a nullable reference and want to pass a value (if it exists) to a function as a parameter, you have to use the awkward construct:\nnullableThing?.let{ thing -> fn(thing, other, parameters) }\nI find myself refactoring my functions to extension functions to reduce the syntactic noise, letting me rewrite the code above as:\nnullableThing?.fn(other, parameters)\nIs that a good thing? I\u2019m not sure. Sometimes it feels a little forced.\n\n\nCompanion objects\nKotlin borrows the concept of companion objects from Scala. Why can\u2019t classes be objects? Perhaps it\u2019s a limitation of the JVM but compared to, say, Python, it feels clunky.\n\n\n        \nFrustrations\nI only have a couple of frustrations with Kotlin.\n\nLack of polymorphism\nOperators and the for loop are syntactic sugar that desugar to method calls. The methods are invoked statically and structurally \u2014 the target does not need to implement an interface that defines the method.\nFor example, a + b desugars to a.add(b). However, there\u2019s no way to write a generic function that sums its parameters, because add is not defined on an interface that can be used as an upper bound.\nThere\u2019s no way to define the following function for any type that has an add operator method.\nfun <T> sum(first: T, second: T) : T = first + second\nYou would have to define overloads for different types, but then wouldn\u2019t be able to call sum within a generic function.\nfun sum(first: Int, second: Int) = first + second\nfun sum(first: Long, second: Long) = first + second\nfun sum(first: Double, second: Double)= first + second\nfun sub(first: Matrix<Double>, second: Matrix<Double>)= first + second\nfun sum(first: Money, second: Money)= first + second\n...\nThat kind of duplication is what generics are meant to avoid!\nExtension methods are also statically bound. That means you cannot write a generic function that calls an extension method on the value of a type parameter.\nFor example, the standard library defines the same extension methods on unrelated types \u2014 forEach, map, flatMap, fold, etc. But there is no concept of, for example, \u201cmappable\u201d or \u201cfoldable\u201d. Nor is there a way of defining such a concept and applying it to existing types to allow you to write generic functions over unrelated types. Kotlin doesn\u2019t have higher kinded types that would let you express this kind of generic function or type classes that would let you add polymorphism without modifying existing type definitions.\nCompared to Rust\u2019s traits, which support extension methods, operator overloading, type classes for parametric polymorphism, and interfaces for subtype polymorphism, Kotlin\u2019s monomorphic extension methods and operator overloading are quite limited and do not help refactor duplicated logic.\nHowever, for typical monomorphic, procedural Java code this is probably not an issue.\n\n\nOptionality is a Special Case\nKotlin\u2019s support for nullable types is implemented by a special case in the type system and special case operators that only apply to nullable references. The operators do not desugar to methods that can be implemented for other types. For example, optionalThing?.foo can be considered a map of the function {thing -> thing.foo} over the option optionalThing. If foo itself is nullable, then it can be considered a flatMap. But the expressions do not desugar to map and flatMap And if you want to map or flatMap a function, you have to use a different syntax: optionalThing?.let(theFunction).\nFor typical Java code, which is monomorphic and uses null references with wild abandon, language support for nullability is invaluable. But I would find it more convenient if it could be used polymorphically, or if Kotlin used a common naming convention for optional and other functor types.\nNull safety is not enforced when you interop with Java code. And you do that a lot. Kotlin doesn\u2019t have many libraries or much of a runtime and makes it easy to call existing Java libraries directly. Kotlin expects you to know what you\u2019re doing with respect to null references when calling Java code, and doesn\u2019t force you to treat every value returned from Java as nullable. As a result, null safety is a bit of an illusion in a lot of our Kotlin code and it has come back to bite us.\n\n\n        \nConclusion\nThe code we\u2019ve been writing has been a mix of coordinating and piping data between existing Java libraries \u2013 Apache HTTP client, Undertow HTTP server, JDBC, Sesame, JSON and XML parsers, and so on \u2013 and algorithmic code that analyses human readable text. For that kind of work, Kotlin has been very useful. The Kotlin code is far more concise than the equivalent Java. In our domain models and algorithmic code, Kotlin\u2019s type safety and especially null safety, has been a big help.\nExactly how happy we\u2019ve been with Kotlin has depended on the design style of the code we\u2019re writing:\nFor functional programming, Kotlin has occasionally been frustrating, because we cannot use parametric polymorphism to factor out duplicated logic as much as we\u2019d like.\nFor object-oriented programming, Kotlin\u2019s concise syntax for class definitions and language support for delegation avoids a lot of Java\u2019s boilerplate.\nHowever, most Java out there is monomorphic, procedural code moving data between \u201cNOJOs\u201d and APIs that expect objects to have \u201cbean\u201d getters and setters. Kotlin has made working with that kind of API much easier and far more concise than doing so in Java.\n\n        \n\n\nAs far as I can tell, RedHat sponsor development of Ceylon but do not actually use it to develop their own products.

In August 2014, Patterson and colleagues launched an open source effort around the core as an enabler for a new class of processors and SoCs with small teams and volumes that can\u2019t afford licensed cores or get the attention of their vendors.\n\nGoogle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Lattice, Microsemi and Oracle \u2013 which is hosting next week\u2019s workshop \u2014 will be among the first members of RISC-V. Tool vendor Bluespec also is joining the group.\n\n\nThe group is still drafting the details of the open source license which will be part of its member agreement. The terms will specify a zero-royalty RAND license as well as verification suites licensees must run to use the RISC-V logo.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBy Telink Semiconductors\u00a0 11.06.2024\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBy Semihouse Electronics\u00a0 11.06.2024\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBy Shanghai Yongming Electronic Co.,Ltd\u00a0 10.31.2024\n\t\t\t\nUsers will need to contribute as open source any changes they make to the core. Nevertheless, \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of room for secret sauce and company-specific implementations,\u201d said Rick O\u2019Connor, executive director of the RISC-V Foundation.\n\nCurrently RISC-V runs Linux and NetBSD, but not Android, Windows or any major embedded RTOSes. Support for other operating systems is expected in 2016.\nSo far, a camera SoC is the only shipping chip said to use the open source core commercially. A handful of university projects use the core including a government-supported effort at IIT Madras in India to develop a homegrown processor family. The IIT chips and three or four other processors in the works use the Rapid IO interconnect as a front-side bus, said O\u2019Connor who also manages the Rapid IO trade group.\nAt the workshop, two talks will describe boot environments for RISC-V in separate papers presented by engineers from Google and a team from HPE and Intel. A representative of military contractor BAE Systems will talk about building the software ecosystem for RISC-V.\nNext page: FPGA accelerators tap RISC-V\n\n\t\t\n        ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, ASSOCIATIONS, CLOUD COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING SYSTEMS OR EQUIPMENT, COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS, DESIGN MANAGEMENT, DESIGN REUSE AND IP, EVENTS, ICS, INDUSTRY WORLD, INTERNET OF THINGS, MANUFACTURING, MICROPROCESSOR, NETWORKING, PATENTS & LICENSING, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT, SEMICONDUCTOR DESIGN & MANUFACTURING, SEMICONDUCTORS, SERVERS, SOC, SUPERCOMPUTERS, TOPICS\n    \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRick MerrittBased in San Jose, Rick writes news and analysis about the electronics industry and the engineering profession for EE Times.

    "scraped_body": "This is the third article in series of articles about the design of Rotor, a library doing asynchronous IO in Rust. It has been about three months since my first article was published. And my first asynchronous code written in rust is almost a year old. That code still works in production (in a non-mission-critical role). This is to say that it\u2019s time to stop rewriting rotor on every occasion and start writing real production code with it. And here is how.Rotor Core LibraryThe intention to create \u201crotor\u201d was desire to build a middleware which allows to compose multiple things to a single event loop. This is valuable because almost every application out there uses multiple protocols for communicating with outside world. And you don\u2019t want to implement a single protocol twice.Rotor 1.0 will only contain minimal things that are needed for composing libraries and nothing moreIf you have followed rotor before, you know it contained an abstraction for streams, which had some opinionated view on how buffering looks like. Many of these things are now in `rotor-stream` which is just a utility library. You may ignore it. You may use multiple versions of it inside a single main loop and so on. So the backwards-compatibility concerns are weaker for it.So What is in Core Library?Here is a minimum that rotor crate contains:A base state machine that maps `mio::Handler` actions almost directly to state machine actionsA way to compose two machines into single one with the same interface (we have two ways: a macro and a generic, see below)A `mio::Handler` that holds a collection (specifically a Slab) of the state machinesAll necessary boilerplate for communication between state machines (a Future/Port pair, see below)That\u2019s basically it. The rotor doesn\u2019t even know anything about the sockets. You create sockets directly (via mio). You are ought to store them in a state machine, but its not enforced in any way. You can structure your code whatever you like.Let\u2019s reiterate basics a little bit:To have multiple state machines in a single event loop, we must differentiate between them. So we use a Slab which stores state machines, and we differentiate them by the mio token.Multiple state machine implementations are combined using an enumeration which has an option for each state machine implementation. On every action, the value is matched and the respective state machine is dispatched. The alternative would be to put trait objects into Slab, which is possible too (but presumably less performant so is not a default).You have a timeout event that is dispatched to the correct machine, but you can\u2019t carry a value in a timeout. Carrying a value would be a headache when doing composition. Anyway, the usual practice is to recheck the time anyway, so it\u2019s not a problem.Similarly with messages, you get a wake-up event and it\u2019s your responsibility to check the appropriate Future object. But we have the object that guarantees that message comes to the right receiver.We have a way to pass global context to all state machines. Where every state machine picks only needed traits on a context. I have written about that before.At this level of abstraction, we must ensure that every error can be handled and no error can make our application panic. Even resource exhaustion (like epoll can\u2019t add another socket). Except, of course, out of memory which you can\u2019t handle in Rust.This is all that needed for 80% of use cases. Few things are going to be added too, but let\u2019s overview how rotor evolved, before discussing the todo list.Rotor ChangesHere are the current decisions. If you think that some of them are bad, please report them to issue tracker. I\u2019m going to stabilize rotor core as quick as possible, so we can build applications without fear that they will break tomorrow.First let\u2019s look at `rotor::Machine` trait:The methods \u201cready\u201d, \u201ctimeout\u201d and \u201cwakeup\u201d should be obvious from the text above.The triple \u201cspawned\u201d, \u201cspawn_error\u201d and \u201ccreate\u201d methods are in charge for creating new state machines and are needed for accepting sockets. Since there is an `Accept` abstraction in `rotor-stream`, most users don\u2019t need to deal with the methods directly. Details will be covered in the documentation. The important thing here is that we are trying to cover every possible failure mode here. This is important for future-proof implementation, even if `rotor_stream::Accept` doesn\u2019t handle all errors well.Every event handler receives a self by value and a mutable object `Scope`. And every event handler returns some complex return value, that contains a state machine and may be some other data. More on return values later.Scope TypeIf you have read my previous articles, you might have noticed that Scope has been dropped in favor of more rich return value. After writing more code, it became clear that it\u2019s impossible to handle everything through the return value. The crucial case is creating a \u201cFuture\u201d object, which allows to send the message to this state machine from another one.Technical details: to send a message to a state machine we send a notification to the main loop (that is a functionality of mio). The notification contains \u2018mio::Token\u2019 that identifies the state machine. The Scope internally contains token, but it\u2019s just an implementation detail of current mio event loop and rotor core. We my change it in future.Currently, Scope object is a thing that:Is passed between all function calls of a state machines as an argumentContains a mutable reference to the Context (see the first article for details about context).Has methods to register a socket and/or a timeout within the event loop (and event is always delivered to this state machine)Allows to create a Future/Port pair which allows to send messages between state machines (`Scope::create_future()`)To give you some feeling of the code here is how rotor_stream::Stream is initialized:It registers a socket in an edge-triggered mode to skip re-registering on changing internal state. But since the same Scope is received in every action handler, it could do register in level-triggered mode and modify it on every occasion.And yes, unlike in first versions of the rotor, the Scope is now a single type (generic over a Context). Mapping scope to a different object at each level of abstraction was a nightmare.Async ResultIn the previous article, there was also a generic `Async` object, which was going to represent a result object of an asynchronous operation. It turns out that it\u2019s either useless or just it\u2019s hard to figure what it should look like. The core rotor has a similar Response object, which has three constructors:The `ok` constructor is similar to `Result::Ok` and returns a state machine to the main loop. Perhaps, the `done` constructor is similar to `Option::None` which means this state machine done its work and should be removed. And finally, the `spawn` constructor means \u201cthis state machine is in state A and please create another one from B\u201d.The \u2018rotor::Response\u2019 type is not an enum but has private internal structure only for future compatibility. Probably some Async type may be invented in future, or another state added. Although, most likely it will be frozen and become a public enum.The `rotor::Machine::Seed` type (N in Response) is a type that may be used to create a state machine. While you could send a state machine to the loop (as in previous versions of the rotor), it would get there uninitialized. So instead of creating another state in every machine we have a separate \u201cinitializer\u201d or \u201cseed\u201d type. The machine is created with method `create(seed, scope)`. So when it is put into a slab it\u2019s already initialized and registered via main loop (using scope).It seems other protocols need some different return value. Here are some types used in rotor ecosystem so far (enums are simplified a bit):The protocol of stream is a bit verbose. On each action you want to return the state machine itself, the next condition you expect to be called on and maximum time that condition might be waited for. This may look complex, but it helps to have a super simple protocol parsers. Like this:The HTTP protocol outlined above shows that return values are sometimes different in different actions of the same protocol. When you receive request headers, you can already provision whether you are going to buffer the whole request to the memory or read it by chunks. Also, you can put a timeout on the whole request processing. Then you just handle each small operation. But in case timeout happens, and you didn\u2019t provision that request will be so large, you can adjust the timeout by returning a new deadline value from the timeout handler.In both cases returning `None` means this state machine has nothing more to do. And in both cases, return value of Option is enough.Mutable ArgumentsEarly in the development of rotor, we opted into treating state machines as immutable things passed by value. And turned out to be a great decision. Still you might notice mutable things on occasion.The most used one is a `Scope`, it allows to \u201cmutate\u201d an event loop by registering sockets and timeouts. Also, Scope contains a mutable reference to a Context, which is our way to mutate a global state if your application has one.The rotor-stream has a `Transport` abstraction. Which allows you to inspect input and output buffers. You can write output and consume input in any event handler. While in theory a user can mess up the buffers, most invariants are handled by rotor_stream anyway. For example, if you left something in the output buffer it will eventually be flushed to the network. If you require some bytes of the input and they are in the input buffer your handler will be dispatched immediately. If you don\u2019t consume bytes and require them again your handler will be called continuously consuming 100% CPU, so you will notice it quickly and a fix will be easy.On the other hand, mutable view on the buffers simplifies the return value and allows you to do many interesting optimizations. For example, you write to the contiguous buffer instead of returning data in small chunks (each being allocated on the heap). Another example, HTTP keeps small chunks in buffer without consuming to be able to push larger chunks to the upper abstraction layers without copying.Another example is the `Response` object in the rotor-http. It allows you to write response progressively, by setting response status first, then adding headers, finally writing some body, possible in few chunks too:Because each event handler gets a mutable response object, you are free to call specific methods at any time. The response object encapsulates a mutable view of an output buffer, and everything is written to the buffer directly instead of being kept in inefficient heap structures like a hash map of headers or similar. Additionally, Response object has an internal state machine that prevents errors of trying to write things out of order, and even guards user of hard errors like sending Content-Length twice.It turns out that combining state machines passed by value and carefully designed mutable views is what makes asynchronous programming simple and efficient.CompositionThe composition was the key point in the development of rotor.There are two types of composition:Horizontal, where you put together multiple implementations of the same protocolVertical, where you stack protocols on each otherThe vertical layers do not need any kind of boilerplate for the composition, they stack on each other by design.The first kind of composition is only implemented for top-level state machines (`rotor::Machine`). There are two options, either `rotor::Compose2` (where 2 is the number of machines combined) or `rotor_compose!()` macro. Macro gives you better names for each child state machine for example:This creates an enum with two options, each embedding a state machine of some type (and also enum for composing Seed\u2019s of the machines). In the case of using `Compose2` type, you get just `A` and `B` options.Another interesting case that will require more investigation is collecting multiple children state machines at some middle layer. I.e. for HTTP2 (and perhaps any other multiplexed protocol) you need to keep multiple request state machines for a single connection. At a glance, you just need a vector of state machines inside connection handler.The Todo ListIt looks like we have a smallest possible core of rotor. But few things are still missing to make it 1.0:1. Global timeouts and messages2. A way to quit the main loop3. Interchangeable main loopsThe distinguishing feature of a global action (either timeout or notification message) is that it can inspect multiple state machines. E.g. it can scan a pool of client connections and shut down inactive ones or do some similar maintenance tasks. Currently, every state machine can only access its own state and a Context (which doesn\u2019t include Slab of other state machines, it\u2019s impossible because of rust borrow checker).Hopefully, #1 and #2 will not change already existing APIs. But #3 may change a lot. The very tempting idea is to run the same code in both the epoll-based event loop and in userspace TCP stack without losing performance.There are a lot more work in rotor-stream, but since you can possibly combine multiple versions of rotor-stream in an application it\u2019s not so crucial. The most interesting thing that should be implemented in rotor-stream is `sendfile` optimization and using memory-mapped files for buffers.The BenchmarksNote, that the micro-benchmarks below are totally unscientific. But people like the benchmarks, so I post them here not to show that rotor-http is the fastest, but to show there isn\u2019t something totally wrong going on.

But the conclusion is that asynchronous implementation looks like faster than golang\u2019s default http implementation. I\u2019m not sure which optimizations allow fasthttp to be faster on single thread (perhaps buffer pooling and avoiding header parsing for hello world example), but even on two threads optimizations don\u2019t help. And nginx is slightly faster (even in non-fair test), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant.Comparing rotor-http to hyper is hard. While it looks like rotor shows some performance improvement, the test is too sensitive to the number of threads used, and that number of threads is probably only useful for the specific microbenchmark.Note that I have not profiled rotor yet, so may miss some important performance regressions. Also, more interesting benchmarks are about memory and CPU usage on a large number of keep-alive connections or partially received responses. But I did not test those complex scenarios yet.Wrapping UpAt the time of writing \u201crotor\u201d has not been touched for about two weeks. While the most of the work on rotor-stream and rotor-http was going during this time. This probably means that basics are pretty okay, and that you can try sufficiently different approaches for building on top of the rotor.Additionally, there is an almost full implementation of HTTP protocol and we have verified that there are neither any performance issues nor any important obstacles for building applications. There are carefully chosen trade-offs, though, that you can avoid if you don\u2019t build on top of rotor-stream.Now it\u2019s time to write more documentation and tests for the implementation. As well as make few more protocols, in particular, the DNS and the HTTP client. Perhaps, they offer different challenges comparing to server implementation.Update: reddit link (/r/golang), hackernews",

The Information reports that Facebook wanted to test users' loyalty despite issues. Where the tests took place and how many users were affected is unclear, but one thing is: people were actually willing to sit through the errors.\"People never stopped coming back.\"\"People never stopped coming back,\" a person familiar with the tests told The Information. In fact, those who were afflicted by the secret errors for long periods defaulted to the mobile browser version of the social network, rather than give up on Facebook entirely.The tests were reportedly part of a larger effort on Facebook's part to prepare for a future conflict with Google that would force its apps out of the Play Store. Facebook, despite being the biggest app developer on Android, presents a growing threat to Google. Even though the social network depends on Google for distribution, its users could one day potentially bypass Google altogether, manually downloading Facebook apps and services via an App Store that compete directly with Google's. While no one is planning to drop Facebook from the Play Store anytime soon, the tests seem to indicate that Facebook leaving the Play Store behind could happen at some point in the foreseeable future.

Sure enough, products purchased by harbingers of failure don\u2019t do so well in the long run: \u201cIf sales to these customers are high, the product is more likely to fail,\u201d the researchers write.\nThe more harbingers of failure like the product, the worse this effect is. If they buy a product repeatedly, it\u2019s even more likely to fail. And the logical opposites also hold true: if harbingers of failure avoid a product, it does pretty well, and popularity with a different group of consumers\u2014the \"harbingers of success\"\u2014spells good news.\nThe interesting thing here is that the researchers tweaked their definitions to see if the effect was robust, or whether it fell apart when they changed something small. They reran the tests, changing what constituted a failed product or what length of time they considered the \"introductory phase,\" yet they\u00a0kept finding the same thing: a certain group of customers was associated with a lot of failed products.\nThey say that their study can be used to help market research, because when data from harbingers of failure is incorporated into\u00a0predictions of product success, the predictions get more accurate.\nNiche tastes\nSo who are the harbingers of failure? The researchers don't have any especially insightful information on them, other than that they're\u00a0people who are more likely to buy the niche products that account for a low proportion of overall sales. \u201cHarbingers have preferences that are systematically different from other customers,\u201d the researchers explain.

    "scraped_body": "\n  \n\tJanuary  5, 2016\n  \n    On the dangers of a blockchain monoculture\n  \n\t\n\nAt first there was Bitcoin\u2020: the world\u2019s most successful cryptocurrency to-date. But lately there has been more and more talk about \u201cthe Bitcoin blockchain\u201d, \u201cthe blockchain\u201d, \u201cblockchain\u201d, or \u201cblockchain technology\u201d. Bloomberg reports that Nasdaq is seeking to show progress using the much-hyped blockchain. LWN notes The Linux Foundation recently announced a project to \u201cadvance blockchain technology\u201d. The Washington Post lists Bitcoin and the blockchain as one of six inventions of magnitude we haven\u2019t seen since the printing press. VISA, Citi, and Nasdaq have invested $30 million into a blockchain company. VCs have collectively invested $1 billion in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bank of America is allegedly trying to load up on \u201cblockchain\u201d patents. The Bank of England says there\u2019s lots of \u201cbuzz around blockchain\u201d and is curious what you\u2019d use \u201cblockchain\u201d for. It seems \u201cblockchain\u201d is becoming an increasingly generic term, like \u201ccloud\u201d or \u201ccyber\u201d. A new breed of snake oil purveyors are peddling \u201cblockchain\u201d as the magic sauce that will power all the world\u2019s financial transactions and unlock the great decentralized database in the sky. But what exactly is a \u201cblockchain\u201d?\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the definitive source, Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s seminal paper \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d. Let\u2019s look for the first reference to \u201cblockchain\u201d. Hmm, there doesn\u2019t seem to be one. The paper contains multiple references to a \u201cproof-of-work chain\u201d, and one reference to a \u201cchain of blocks\u201d, but other than that neither \u201cblockchain\u201d or \u201cblock chain\u201d ever make an appearance in the Bitcoin paper.\n\nSo if it\u2019s not defined in the Bitcoin paper, what does \u201cblockchain\u201d actually mean? I\u2019ve asked a lot of people this question, ranging from renowned cryptographers and distributed systems experts to Bitcoin enthusiasts to people not particularly versed in either Bitcoin, distributed systems, or cryptography. No two people have ever given me the same answer. I can try to take a crack at the question myself.\n\nHere are the interesting properties of the Bitcoin \u201cblockchain\u201d as I see them:\n\n\nReplicated log: Bitcoin uses a transaction log which is replicated from the winning miner to all of the peers in the network. Log-based replication is an increasingly popular tool for building distributed systems, and is used by many databases and message queues.\nMerkle tree: The Bitcoin paper describes incorporating Merkle trees into the interior structure of blocks, but overall I think \u201cMerkle tree\u201d describes the structure of Bitcoin\u2019s replicated log / \u201cproof-of-work chain\u201d. While not described in the paper as such, I would argue that the overall structure of the Bitcoin \u201cblockchain\u201d is effectively a very flat-looking special case of a Merkle tree. Perhaps the flat, log-like structure (which feels a bit like a fast-forwardable git history) is why \u201cSatoshi\u201d chose to describe it as a \u201cchain\u201d in the Bitcoin paper. That said I think Satoshi\u2019s expertise around Merkle trees is generally questionable: Bitcoin\u2019s Merkle trees previously had oddly broken behavior (CVE-2012-2459) and utilize a \u201cnaive\u201d construction without type flags for leaf versus interior nodes, leading me to believe Satoshi is not an academic cryptographer (the Bitcoin paper is also lacking in details around the structure of the \u201cblockchain\u201d which are typically present in academic papers on cryptographic protocols). If we take the hash-based structure of the \u201cblockchain\u201d independent of the use of a proof-of-work function, I think it largely resembles Merkle log proofs as used by systems like Certificate Transparency.\nDecentralized \u201cconsensus by lottery\u201d using a proof-of-work: The real innovation of Bitcoin, in my opinion, is the use of a lottery-like mechanism to decide the next \u201cblock\u201d to insert into the \u201cMerkelized\u201d replicated log, specifically the proof-of-work function and difficulty ratcheting mechanisms that increase the amount of work required in response to the number of miners working on the problem. Indeed the paper talks quite a bit about a \u201cproof-of-work chain\u201d. However, in discussing the definition of \u201cblockchain\u201d with several people, whether or not a \u201cblockchain\u201d necessarily includes a proof-of-work was one of the most contentious topics. There are several reasons why \u201cblockchain\u201d advocates may want to distance themselves from being necessarily tied-by-definition to a proof-of-work function, which I\u2019ll cover later in this post.\n\u201cTransactions\u201d authenticated with public-key cryptography: Bitcoin uses an elliptic curve practically no one else uses called secp256k1 (the rest of the crypto world has largely moved on to Curve25519) to digitally sign all transactions with an algorithm called ECDSA. But really it\u2019s not the elliptic curve or signature algorithm that are important (for what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think Bitcoin chose particularly good ones), so I think it\u2019s silly to base the definition of a \u201cblockchain\u201d on e.g. the use of elliptic curve cryptography and ECDSA (especially as there\u2019s interest in the Bitcoin community in moving to Schnorr signatures). In my opinion, a \u201cblockchain\u201d is defined by the use of public-key cryptography in general for authenticating transactions. What\u2019s a \u201ctransaction\u201d? The word \u201ctransaction\u201d has a very specific meaning in both databases and finance which I\u2019ll go into below. Bitcoin meets a limited definition of one but not the other.\nPublic decentralized transaction ledger: Bitcoin \u201csolves\u201d one particular problem: decentralized public transaction ledgers. \u201cBlockchain technology\u201d as it exists today in Bitcoin is effectively a decentralized reconciliation system which maintains a global transaction ledger without a central authority. There are many proposals to use the Bitcoin blockchain for other purposes, which I\u2019ll discuss below.\nBroadcast protocol: Bitcoin broadcasts all transactions to all nodes in a peer-to-peer system. This has a lot of interesting properties (and is an idea I explored in my experimental messaging system \u201cConfusion\u201d) but has inherent scalability limits.\nScripting language / \u201cSmart contracts\u201d: a very cool feature I will acknowledge exists and give a quick hat tip to Ethereum, but I will not be discussing it in this post. I think \u201csmart contracts\u201d can exist outside of blockchains and that not everyone using \u201cblockchain technology\u201d is necessarily interested in them. Apologies if you think these are what make the blockchain the blockchain but I don\u2019t, and may address this subject in depth in a subsequent blog post if there\u2019s enough interest. \n\n\nWhen we look at the list above, what makes Bitcoin unique? To me, it\u2019s really about the \u201cproof-of-work chain\u201d approach to creating a replicated transaction ledger. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, as soon as we remove the \u201cconsensus-by-lottery\u201d using proof-of-work part of the \u201cblockchain\u201d, it starts to lose meaning and lapses into a much more general set of ideas which solve a similar class of problems but have been in use for decades, are distinct from Bitcoin, and are in no way \u201cblockchain technology\u201d.\n\nI would argue the etymology of \u201cblockchain\u201d can be traced to a sort of mutated, colloquial term for Satoshi\u2019s original \u201cproof-of-work chain\u201d concept, and that as soon as you move beyond consensus-by-proof-of-work you are no longer using a \u201cblockchain\u201d. That is to say: I think systems which are not transaction ledgers and do not use Bitcoin\u2019s consensus-by-lottery using a proof-of-work function approach are not \u201cblockchains\u201d. I\u2019ll again call out Certificate Transparency again as a system which has many of the same properties as the Bitcoin blockchain, but which I would not define as a \u201cblockchain\u201d and whose creators would probably not describe it as a \u201cblockchain\u201d either.\n\n\u2020Note to \u201cthat guy\u201d on Hacker News: yes, there were cryptocurrencies before Bitcoin. I\u2019m aware. You don\u2019t need to educate me on them. But they don\u2019t count, sorry.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain: the world\u2019s worst database #\nWould you use a database with these features?\n\n\nUses approximately the same amount of electricity as could power an average American household for a day per transaction\nSupports 3 transactions / second across a global network with millions of CPUs/purpose-built ASICs\nTakes over 10 minutes to \u201ccommit\u201d a transaction\nDoesn\u2019t acknowledge accepted writes: requires you read your writes, but at any given time you may be on a blockchain fork, meaning your write might not actually make it into the \u201cwinning\u201d fork of the blockchain (and no, just making it into the mempool doesn\u2019t count). In other words: \u201cblockchain technology\u201d cannot by definition tell you if a given write is ever accepted/committed except by reading it out of the blockchain itself (and even then)\nCan only be used as a transaction ledger denominated in a single currency, or to store/timestamp a maximum of 80 bytes per transaction\n\n\nBut it\u2019s decentralized!\n\nWhile Bitcoin does a reasonable job of modeling financial transactions denominated in the one and only one cryptocurrency that is Bitcoin, it generally fails to live up to the ideals of a \u201ctransaction\u201d in databases, and what it manages to do comes at an incredible cost in terms of electricity and time. Bitcoin fails to achieve the properties of byzantine fault tolerance, which is perhaps a bit unreasonable to ask in order for Bitcoin to be considered sound, but from a less formal perspective Bitcoin has no acknowledgement protocol for accepted \u201ctransactions\u201d beyond reading your current view of the \u201cblockchain\u201d, and because Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cconsensus-by-lottery\u201d mechanism is inherently racy by design (who can solve the proof-of-work the fastest? We\u2019ll call that an accepted write. Uhoh, two people solved it at the same time) we can never be quite sure that a particular transaction we don\u2019t yet see in the blockchain will eventually be committed (and no, the mempool is not some magical band-aid that can solve this problem). Compare this to pretty much any database or realtime payment system in the world, where getting a speedy \u201cack\u201d (or error) of some sort, and having it mean something, is considered a basic feature. Even MongoDB can do better than this.\n\nAs a side-effect, Bitcoin can also be used as a decentralized \u201ctimestamping\u201d / audit log service (as noted in the original paper), however there are more efficient protocols which can solve the decentralized audit log problem. Yet again I\u2019ll look to Certificate Transparency, which solves the problem of verifiable audit logs without the use of a proof-of-work function, making it much easier and less computationally intensive to append to, query, and audit. For these reasons, I specifically call out Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain as being most noteworthy as a decentralized ledger, and nothing else.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cblockchain\u201d-esque structure of Certificate Transparency\u2019s Merkle log proofs, without any pesky proof-of-work function\nNext-generation protocols #\nBefore Bitcoin, the state-of-the-art in decentralized reconciliation over the Internet generally involved SCPing around GPG encrypted batch settlement files and processing them with zSeries mainframes. This is slow moving, not easily auditable, and clearly leaves a lot of room for improvement.\n\nBitcoin was a great demonstration of what is possible. But as the entire Bitcoin ecosystem approaches a gross payment volume size nearing that of single top 10 US retailer (and about 1/10,000th the transaction volume of VISA), the \u201cpublish all transactions to everybody\u201d approach Bitcoin uses is starting to show its limits. Bitcoin\u2019s scalability is ultimately limited by the number of transactions that can fit in a block and the rate at which blocks are published to the network, and the fight over a switch to a larger block size has grown increasingly dramatic. But even if Bitcoin adopts a larger block size, the fact it\u2019s already hitting scalability limits despite its comparatively small transaction volume does not bode well for the \u201cblockchain\u201d approach, especially as \u201cblockchain technology\u201d is being touted as a potential solution for systems which operate at multiple orders of magnitude higher transaction volume than Bitcoin.\n\nThe \u201ccentral\u201d problem (pun intended, sorry) is that despite claims of being \u201cdecentralized\u201d, the blockchain represents a single ledger which is global to the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. It seems Satoshi\u2019s back-of-the-napkin math doesn\u2019t really work out, and publishing all transactions to everyone is expensive in terms of bandwidth and storage. There are attempts within the Bitcoin ecosystem to address this deficiency, for example blocks could be made larger as proposed in Bitcoin-XT, or some transactions could be moved to \u201csidechains\u201d as proposed in systems like the Bitcoin Lightning Network. But the Lightning Network is useful only for a ledger that is denominated in Bitcoin, and we still have to deal with the \u201ccentral\u201d Bitcoin blockchain, whose size is likely to continue to increase despite the addition of various \u201csidechain\u201d mechanisms. (Edit: Several people have pointed out the Lightning Network allows for offline transactions and its not a \u201csidechain\u201d, and also that the Lightning Network can support non-Bitcoin denominated transactions)\n\nFor solving the general problem of over-the-Internet decentralized reconciliation though, we\u2019ll need \u201cblockchains\u201d denominated in currencies other that Bitcoin too. But now we have a new problem: how do we exchange different currencies or other financial instruments between blockchains denominated in different currencies? While this problem may appear to have a straightforward answer, it becomes a bit more difficult when you take into account that moving money between ledgers actually involves integrating with those ugly legacy systems I was talking about earlier which can already move money denominated in \u201clegacy\u201d fiat currencies. Turning your Bitcoins into cold hard cash denominated in the currency of your choice is perhaps the cryptocurrency\u2019s biggest problem beyond scalability (see Mt. Gox and the many thefts related to shady Bitcoin exchanges on /r/sorryforyourloss).\n\nThe solution to all of these problems requires taking a step back from Bitcoin and re-evaluating the actual problem we wish to solve. The \u201cproof-of-work chain\u201d approach used by Bitcoin is ultimately trying to solve a distributed consensus problem, where we have many parties who want to reconcile a transaction ledger over the Internet. Bitcoin uses digital signatures to ensure the integrity of each transaction, and via proof-of-work manually selects an authority to decide which transactions are included in a particular block. However, there are far more efficient distributed consensus algorithms than this which don\u2019t involve a proof of work. So perhaps we should consider those.\nDecentralized ledger protocols #\nNext generation decentralized transaction ledgers are a topic I\u2019ve blogged about before, but as this is a quickly evolving field some of my \u201cpicks\u201d have changed. I would like to call out the following projects as ones that are interesting to me today:\n\n\nInterledger: a protocol for making payments across different payment networks developed by Ripple Labs\u2020. Interledger uses escrows to handle movement of funds between ledgers which effectively provide the same function as Bitcoin exchanges but as first-class citizens within the Interledger network. The Interledger protocol is formally modeled using TLA+, also used by Amazon for building mission-critical systems. Per the paper: \u201cUnlike previous approaches, this protocol requires no\nglobal coordinating system or blockchain.\u201d\nStellar SCP: a formally modeled distributed consensus algorithm designed for Internet-scale operation, which provides global agreement among localized \u201cquorum shards\u201d. SCP provides distributed transaction ledgers denominated in the currency of your choice. Stellar plans to launch a cryptocurrency called \u201cLumen\u201d using the protocol.\n\n\nIn my previous blog post \u201cThe Death of Bitcoin\u201d I had also mentioned Hyperledger, Tendermint, and several others. I\u2019ll get to those in a bit.\nBitcoin-NG #\n\n\n\n\nMy Death of Bitcoin blog post also touched on the idea that the blockchain could be subject to incremental refinement in the same way the Watt steam engine massively improved on the previous Newcomen steam engine. A few months later we saw exactly that with Bitcoin-NG (paper), a protocol that inverts the ordering of Bitcoin consensus: a miner is first elected leader by winning the proof-of-work \u201clottery\u201d by mining a \u201ckey block\u201d, and then once elected leader becomes a transaction broker who can mint \u201cmicro-blocks\u201d via digital signature until the next leader is elected. Decoupling leader election from the publishing of transactions allows the overall system to have a much higher throughput as the rate new transactions are published is no-longer coupled to the rate at which the proof-of-work problem is solved.\nCothority #\n\n\nImage also from above referenced 32C3 Cothority talk\n\nI\u2019ve referenced Certificate Transparency several times in this post, but it has a few drawbacks: it\u2019s a point-solution specifically for the purpose of X.509 certificates, and as a system that merely logs and audits what certificates CAs provide to it, it has no consensus protocol and therefore cannot be used for things like finding the canonical certificates for a given domain name.\n\nFor what Certificate Transparency is trying to accomplish, this is perfectly fine. However, given the several years they\u2019ve spent working on it, it feels like a bit of a shame that it only serves the purpose of authenticating X.509 certificates when the general idea behind it seems much more powerful.  This is perhaps how people feel about \u201cthe blockchain\u201d when they see it applied only to Bitcoin. Edit: Google is working on a \u201cGeneral Transparency\u201d key/value store called Trillian based on the same ideas as Certificate Transparency.\n\nCothority is a framework for building collective authority systems using a Merkelized log ala CT, a consensus algorithm, and threshold signatures (using Ed25519 for threshold Schnorr signatures). By combining the ideas of consensus systems with a CT-like witness protocol, it provides a generalized framework for auditable decentralized trust and consensus which can be used for many of the same things people are pitching \u201cblockchain technology\u201d for without the need for a costly proof-of-work-based \u201cconsensus by lottery\u201d.\n\nThese two images are taken from Philipp Jovanovic\u2019s 32C3 talk on Cothority, where they were juxtaposed as two potential solutions to the same problem. While I think Bitcoin-NG is a brilliant optimization on the original Bitcoin design (and one I\u2019d strongly suggest Bitcoin adopt some variant thereof), Cothority provides many of the same properties without a proof of work function.\n\n\u2020The correct Blockchainiac response to a mention of Ripple Laps is to ignore the TLA+ descriptions of the Interledger protocol in the back of their paper and immediately write an essay on Hacker News about how Ripple is a scam and therefore by an ad hominem fallacy they can\u2019t produce anything of merit. But surely Bitcoin isn\u2019t a ponzi scheme, it\u2019s the real deal!\nBlockchain! Blockchain! Blockchain! #\n\n\nLately I\u2019ve seen a lot of systems of the sort I previously wouldn\u2019t have classified as \u201cblockchains\u201d (because they do not use a proof-of-work chain) who previously seemed to be distancing themselves from Bitcoin and the proof-of-work approach go FULL BLOCKCHAIN:\n\n\n\nHave you accepted THE BLOCKCHAIN into your heart?\n\nThis is Tendermint, a protocol I highlighted in my last blog post as being based on a proof-of-stake system and distributed consensus protocol, as opposed to a proof-of-work scheme like Bitcoin. Now there is no mention of proof-of-stake anywhere on their web page.\n\nIs Tendermint a blockchain? I guess there\u2019s no question about it now! Whatever Tendermint turns out to be, its creators leave little room to doubt that it is, indeed, a BLOCKCHAIN (blockchain blockchain).\n\nHyperledger, another protocol I highlighted in my last blog post, has also undergone a blockchain makeover. Their old web site now redirects to https://blockchain.linuxfoundation.org/ (as reported on by LWN), where we no longer see any mention of \u201cHyperledger\u201d, just Enterprise Blockchain 2.0 technology!\n\nWith this much ambiguity as to the actual definition coupled with hyperrepetition, \u201cblockchain\u201d is fast on its way to becoming the new \u201ccloud\u201d: one of those words whose actual meaning is nebulous and unspecific, but whatever it is it must be so important people can\u2019t shut up about it!\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong: I like Hyperledger and Tendermint, or at least, I thought I did. Per my personal rubric above though, neither of these systems are \u201cblockchains\u201d because they do not use a proof-of-work-based consensus protocol.\nThe great decentralized database in the sky #\nThe great thing about a nebulous term is that it knows no limits. What can\u2019t you put in the blockchain? Perhaps we could encode Wikipedia into the blockchain, or store the entire archive of Netflix videos in the blockchain. All of archive.org could go in the blockchain. We could move the entire World Wide Web into the blockchain so all web pages are permanent and live forever.\n\nThe only real question is: what can\u2019t you put in the blockchain?\n\nWell, the answer is: not much. The Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s ability to store data is greatly limited by its \u201cpublish everything to everyone everywhere\u201d nature.\n80 bytes per transaction is pretty much the limit, and the system is already hitting scalability bottlenecks at a relatively modest scale.\n\nTo go beyond that, we need a different protocol. We can\u2019t just throw \u201cblockchain technology\u201d at the problem. The relevant algorithms do not exist in the Bitcoin codebase. We need a different protocol.\n\nThis is a problem many people have tried working on for a very long time. I\u2019ve blogged about it before. There have been many pretenders to the throne: Xanadu, FreeNet, GNUnet, MojoNation/MNet, Tahoe-LAFS, OneSwarm, BitSpray, MaidSafe, IPFS. I\u2019ll note MojoNation specifically as a system that tried to tie storage service to a cryptocurrency.\n\nSo far the leading technology for the decentralized database seems to be BitTorrent, which dominates Internet traffic. But it doesn\u2019t make for much of a database, only a blob store. Perhaps you\u2019re now thinking: TorrentChain! Yeah, that\u2019s been tried. But I don\u2019t think the great database in the sky is going to be unlocked by cobbling together disparate parts into a Rube Goldberg apparatus.\n\nBelieve me that I would like to see the craziest fantasies of what people hope to accomplish with decentralized systems realized. But the blockchain is probably not the technology that is going to do it.\nConclusion #\nI feel \u201cblockchain technology\u201d has not delivered a lot of practical value: compared to most payment systems the value Bitcoin moves and the transaction rate are both rather insignificant (and Bitcoin is all that matters: all other blockchain-based systems move practically nothing by comparison). Bitcoin is hitting scalability limits under a relatively modest payment volume.\n\nThe only thing I think \u201cblockchain technology\u201d has actually delivered on is hype: a press release with \u201cblockchain\u201d in the title garners media attention (I direct you back to the opening paragraph of this post if you doubt that). Old financial institutions recruiting for \u201cblockchain\u201d positions are a lot more likely to find talented engineers than if they have job reqs to maintain decades-old legacy systems. I won\u2019t dispute that \u201cblockchain\u201d is pretty much guaranteed to engender a lot more excitement in your average engineer than \u201cledger\u201d, \u201creconciliation\u201d, \u201csettlement\u201d, or \u201cnotarization\u201d.\n\nIn the meantime, \u201cblockchain technology\u201d advocates need a litany of big-name positive endorsements of \u201cblockchain\u201d to lend credibility to the idea, even if it\u2019s little more than expressing interest in the concept. Thus we wind up with a positive feedback loop of hype without anyone actually delivering on anything valuable.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the idea of decentralized transaction ledgers and timestamping systems lacks merit, but I don\u2019t think copying and pasting Satoshi-and-friends\u2019 codebase all over the place is the best way to go about solving the problem. If you\u2019re doing that, please at least take a look at Bitcoin-NG and fix the broken Merkle trees.\n\nIn Blockchainiac terms, I don\u2019t want there to be \u201con-chain\u201d and \u201coff-chain\u201d. I want \u201csidechains all the way down\u201d. I want systems that are built from the ground up to support that model. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t scale. Decentralize the blockchain!\n\nI want protocols that are formally proven to come to consensus correctly, not protocols that are formally proven to be broken.\n\nI want each transaction to use less electricity than I do in a day. Much less. I want the entire system to use a lot less electricity than the entire nation of Ireland.\n\nI want more than 3 transactions per second.\n\nI want consensus faster than every 10 minutes. 10 seconds is a lot better.\n\nThe most interesting ideas I\u2019m seeing are coming from people who describe their protocols as requiring no blockchain.\n\nI worry the media are giving undue attention to questionable ideas simply because there\u2019s a lot of \u201cbuzz around blockchain\u201d.\n\nI worry that the hype surrounding the \u201cblockchain\u201d might lead those who award research budgets to favor blockchain-based solutions over those that are blockchain-free.\n\nI worry financial institutions might pick a \u201cblockchain\u201d-based solution where a blockchain-free solution might be by all quantitative metrics better in every regard, simply because they\u2019ve heard what a big deal \u201cblockchain\u201d is.\n\nBut perhaps my concerns are overblown, and this is just a giant semantic argument. Maybe \u201cblockchain technology\u201d is just becoming a meaningless all-encompassing umbrella term for decentralized protocols. Can it do ledgers? Sure! Data? Why not? Computation? Smart contracts baby!\n\nPerhaps \u201cpost-blockchain\u201d protocols will start branding themselves as \u201cblockchain technology\u201d just to stay relevant.\n\n\u201cCyber\u201d is starting to grow on me, so why not \u201cblockchain\u201d too? Who needs a metaverse; I\u2019ll see you on the blockchain.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    869\n    Kudos\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    869\n    Kudos\n  \n\n\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n          I am standing a few feet away from a conference table, about to test something called a \u201cHolojam.\u201d It is made of head-mounted displays, motion capture cameras and many lines of code. Affixed to the edges of the table, as well as to my hands and ankles, are little plastic balls, which are used to track things in the virtual environment. Like QR codes, they help the software interpret the table as a table.\n      \n    Ken Perlin, who directs the Media Research Lab at New York University, describes it to me as the \u201cfirst community-created collaborative 4-D spacetime sculpture.\u201d Then he flips the switch. The space I am standing in is a kind of forest clearing at night, with a bright moon illuminating tall trees. As I move my head, the view subtly warps. \u201cTo give you freedom of movement,\u201d he says, \u201cwe had to make everything more cartooney. The moon and the trees are like billboards, not 3-D. We decided it was more important to have immediacy and presence than high fidelity.\u201dBut isn\u2019t fidelity what makes a virtual reality feel real? I want wind to whistle past as I walk in full Doppler splendor. Sunlight should gently dapple on the grainy surface of a wood table, and objects should possess the heft and feel that they really do. Many in the field buy into this kind of supremacy of detail. Others, though, believe it\u2019s a fetishization that obscures how effective virtual reality isn\u2019t just about verisimilitude. As with the way we experience reality itself, it\u2019s also about the way we lie to ourselves.UNLIKELY AVATAR: Ken Perlin\u2019s Holojam virtual reality system lets users interact with each other through cartoonish avatars.Photography by Sebastian Herscher; Holojam Artwork by David Lobser\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          Perlin knows about the verisimilitude angle. Early in his career, he worked on the movie Tron, now known for its seminal use of computer-generated animation. Dissatisfied with the digital sterility of visual effects, he began investigating ways to create \u201ccontrolled random processes,\u201d which led to more realistic depictions of things like smoke and fire. Today his influential textural effect is called \u201cPerlin noise.\u201dBut Perlin is skeptical of the merits of an indefinite push toward more visual detail. While the emphasis in commercial and gaming virtual reality has been on boosting graphical resolution, there is not necessarily a one-to-one correlation between pixel density and realism. \u201cPeople who are myopic,\u201d says Perlin, \u201cdon\u2019t think they\u2019re living in a fantasy world.\u201d The human foveal region itself, says Perlin, maxes out at around 60 pixels per linear degree\u2014smaller than that, he says, \u201cand you\u2019re falling between the cells.\u201d The mistake of many recent computer games, Perlin argues, is to confuse realism with believability.This, in essence, describes what many academic researchers see as the current, game-driven state of virtual reality. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be real, any more than a movie is real,\u201d Perlin argues. Evan Suma, a research assistant professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies (Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, is an alum), says he worries that virtual reality, once the novelty has subsided, may reach a plateau; because, as he says, most of the experiences being created, while graphically sophisticated, are \u201ccouch-locked.\u201d \u201cA lot of the magic for me is lost when you\u2019re just sitting down and moving.\u201d\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          \nWe could walk through an infinite kingdom in our living room.\nWhen we walk, by contrast, we get more spatial cues from the environment, and we are able to pay more attention: It\u2019s a cognitively richer experience. Research shows, for example, that children who walk to school can create more robust maps of their routes than those who are driven.1 \u201cMuch of our sense of reality has to do with proprioception,\u201d Perlin argues. \u201cEven if my hand were invisible,\u201d he says, reaching for a pen on the table, \u201cI would have no problem picking this up, thanks to that notion of body sense, of balance, of the sensation at the bottom of the feet.\u201d To know space is to move one\u2019s self through space.It is now easy enough, using motion capture, treadmills, and other technologies, to create canned versions of walk-through virtual environments. But how, absent creating some sprawling, Borgesian one-to-one mapping of the actual world, do you create a virtual space that can be realistically walked through and yet is many times larger than one\u2019s living room?You delude yourself, of course. Scientists are exploiting the natural inaccuracies in people\u2019s own proprioception, via a technique called \u201credirected walking,\u201d to create the perception of space where none exists. Frank Steinicke, a professor of Human-Computer Interaction at the Department of Informatics at the University of Hamburg, is one of its pioneers (he is also recognized, unofficially at least, to have spent the most time of anyone on the planet\u201424 hours, with short breaks\u2014in an immersive environment, wearing an Oculus Rift head-mounted display). With redirected walking, Steinicke tells me, users can sense they are exploring the twisting byways of a virtual city when in reality they are simply walking in circles inside a lab.\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          Without getting feedback on our heading, Steinicke says, in most cases we begin to drift, even retracing our path, after as little as a few dozen meters. The phenomenon has been noted in people who wander endlessly lost in the forest or deserts\u2014particularly when the sun is not visible\u2014even as they hardly cover any ground at all.2 In an experiment in which people were blindfolded and left to wander for 50 minutes, they began walking in surprisingly small circles of less than 20 meters in diameter. Virtual environments themselves present a kind of perceptual distortion: For \u201creasons that are not really known,\u201d says Steinicke, even when virtual spaces are modeled one-to-one with real environments, subjects routinely underestimate distance.Redirected walking goes one step further, exploiting a discrepancy that arises as we walk and rotate our gaze: We can confuse the field of \u201coptic flow\u201d that comes our way as corresponding to a curved path, even when walking straight. In experiments, subjects immersed into a virtual world did not notice when their physical 90-degree turn translated into just an 80-degree turn in virtual space. Compression also went unnoticed in forward walking speeds, distance covered, and path curvature. By stacking various kinds of misdirection, an infinite virtual space can be mapped onto a confined real space. We could walk through an infinite kingdom in our living room.The perceptual sleight of hand, which comes largely due to vision\u2019s outsize role in our perceptual array, can be applied to more than just walking. As Suma notes, even hand motions can be redirected, through what he calls \u201chaptic retargeting.\u201d By \u201cwarping\u201d the virtual environment\u2014or the sense of one\u2019s virtual body in it\u2014researchers have been able to decouple what a subject\u2019s hand seems to be doing from what it is really doing by, again, playing on our visual dominance.\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          He describes a \u201cfun demo\u201d\u2014dubbed the \u201cone for three illusion\u201d\u2014in which a user is instructed to pick up and stack cubes in a virtual environment. Users are first shown three real cubes on a table. As they don a virtual reality headset, two of the real cubes are taken away\u2014though three cubes still exist in virtual space. As users reach for one of the now-illusory cubes, a subtle visual warping causes them to correct their hand trajectory in the real world, so that they reach toward the one remaining real cube. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever realize that you\u2019re only ever touching one object,\u201d says Suma. Users, As reported by a team at Microsoft Research, users\u00a0found the task \u201crepetitive\u201d\u2014until they took off the headsets and saw what was really happening.1\nAs with the way we experience reality itself, it\u2019s also about the way we lie to ourselves.\nNot only can researchers create inconsistencies between virtual and real spaces, they can make the virtual spaces themselves impossible. Suma has created two seemingly separate virtual rooms that somehow occupy the same space, and are larger on the inside than they appear from the outside\u2014not unlike Dr. Who\u2019s Tardis. He has found, in experiments, that subjects only begin to notice violation of the rules of Euclidean space at high levels of overlap. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist in the real world,\u201d he says of his impossible spaces. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why our perceptual system should have developed a sensitivity to this.\u201dOn the other hand, there are visual cues that can\u2019t be messed with. We\u2019ve evolved to pay close attention to cues like the horizon line, because they help us orient ourselves. Even very subtle manipulations of a visible horizon line or a stable view of a ground plane\u2014essential for proprioception\u2014cause people to get unstable. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get it exactly right\u201d in virtual reality, Suma says, \u201cyou\u2019re better off hiding it.\u201d\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          But there would not have been a selective pressure to detect non-Euclidean angles or warped spaces. By aiming at these soft targets in our visual system, scientists can trick us into believing we\u2019re in some pretty remarkable spaces. The real key to this make-believe, though, may be in letting one person trick another.WATCH CAREFULLY: Users wearing a virtual reality headset can be made to believe they are manipulating three real-space blocks, when in fact there is only one.Azmandian, M., Hancock, M., Benko, H., Ofek, E. & Wilson, A. Haptic retargeting: Dynamic repurposing of passive haptics for enhanced virtual reality experiences.\u00a0To appear in\u00a0\u201cProceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems\u201d (2016).Back in his conference room, Perlin suddenly slips on his own head-mounted display, and he\u2014or, rather, a large, bright, animated figure that looks like some failed entry for an Olympic mascot competition\u2014appears across the clearing from me. He waves his hand, tracing a line that seems to hang in the air. And then, with eyes no more lifelike than a snowman\u2019s two pieces of coal, he looks at me.\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          This is a curiously powerful moment. Locking eyes with the simple avatar unleashes that warm, almost familiar prickling of human connection. What do you want from me? What can I do for you? Just the fact that someone else is in the virtual environment underscores the sense of \u201csocial presence,\u201d as media scholar Carrie Heeter has called it. \u201cIf other people are in the virtual world, that is more evidence that the world exists.\u201d3 The act of recognition inside a shared space validates both your existence and the existence of the space. A lack of recognition denies those things, not unlike the Hollywood trope in which a person, who has not yet learned he is a ghost, tries in vain to get other people\u2019s attention.We are social mimickers. When we see our peers accepting the reality of an environment, we are encouraged to accept it too. Our behavior in virtual space is no different. While much of the current energy in virtual reality research is channeled into getting things to look real as possible, Perlin suggests that even with heightened visual verisimilitude, virtual reality will still feel solitary unless a compelling social presence is achieved. \u201cThe holodeck,\u201d says Perlin, \u201cis other people.\u201dWe even take the form of our avatars as a social cue, reverting to real-world human dynamics quickly in virtual environments. In the so-called \u201cProteus Effect,\u201d people begin to quickly adopt the subtle psychological dynamics associated with their particular avatars. As a Stanford University study noted, \u201cParticipants who had more attractive avatars exhibited increased self-disclosure and were more willing to approach opposite-gendered strangers after less than 1 minute of exposure to their altered avatar.\u201d4 As William Bricken argued, \u201cpsychology is the physics of virtual reality.\u201d5\nRealism will be one of the first qualities to be discarded as we make virtual space more realistic.\n\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          It should be little surprise that I was arrested by Perlin\u2019s cartoon eyes: Eye contact is one of our most potent non-verbal communication forms, in the real world or not. What some have found in virtual worlds, however, is that eye contact per se is less important than head movement\u2014which can also signal acknowledgement and intentionality. When Perlin first began to set up the Holojam, a few years ago, his cartoonish characters had no faces, just square boxes atop bodies. \u201cOne person shrugged,\u201d says Perlin. \u201cEven though you couldn\u2019t see the shoulders, you could only see this box, you knew it was a shrug because we only move our head like that when we shrug.\u201dDid Perlin look realistic to me? No. But faced with the problems of the \u201cuncanny valley,\u201d maybe a cartoon is better: It stops us from thinking about whether some- thing is real and just lets us feel that it is. The cognitive scientist Mel Slater defines the \u201cplausibility illusion\u201d in virtual reality as the sense \u201cthat what is apparently happening is really happening (even though you know for sure it is not).\u201d6 We can become invested even in blocky, 1980s-arcade representations of people. Slater conducted a set of experiments in which a low-fidelity virtual character was \u201cshocked\u201d while people watched. As the shocks to the hapless avatar grew in intensity, the onlookers grew increasingly anxious. \u201cBugs Bunny is not realistic,\u201d Perlin says, \u201cbut believable.\u201dPerlin\u2019s Holojam environment\u2014which is currently rendered off of a smartphone to be mobile\u2014is only bound to get more realistic, graphically, as head-mounted display technology and processing power continues to improve. And when high-quality untethered body tracking\u2014he says there\u2019s \u201ccurrently no commercial market\u201d\u2014arrives, virtual reality can begin to become a social space. \u201cBy allowing people to walk around,\u201d as opposed to what he calls the \u201cWall-E model,\u201d he argues that \u201cwe can get to the important questions: What\u2019s going to be the impact on people when they interact with each other in a world that\u2019s been transformed?\u201d It may very well transform the unreal into the real.\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          We shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that realism will be one of the first qualities to be discarded as we make virtual space more realistic. After all, we do it in the actual (real) world all the time. Casino entrances use curved paths so people don\u2019t slow to make perpendicular turns, drawing gamblers \u201cfurther into the \u2018mousetrap,\u2019 \u201d as described in anthropologist Natascha Dow Sch\u00fcll\u2019s book Addiction by Design. So-called casino \u201catmospherics\u201d like background music, meanwhile, are carefully modulated to sit just below the threshold of consciousness\u2014to do otherwise, one industry expert quoted by Sch\u00fcll notes, \u201crestores \u2026 your cognitive state to where you can make rational decisions.\u201d The whole effort, as one casino designer describes it, is to create for gamblers a \u201cdifferent plane on which they lose their sense of reality.\u201dThere are even slivers of virtual reality creeping in. Devices like slot machines have been made more immersive with virtual reels, liberating them from physical laws of probability and putting players under the illusion that they can win more often than they actually can.Retail experiences can also be designed to confuse. Alan Penn of University College London has described the meandering pathway through an Ikea store as intentionally confusing: \u201cAs you move through the showroom you rapidly become dissociated from everyday life\u2014all views of the external world are obscured and even one\u2019s sense of direction is removed by the twists and turns of the route. At the same time you are shown stage set glimpses of what your life might be like. The effect is more or less subliminal.\u201d7\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          So while Steinicke, Perlin, and Suma are operating on digital photons, and retail and gambling designers are not, there is a point of intersection in their work: Whatever space we find ourselves in requires our active interpretation, and allows for somebody else\u2019s active obfuscation. It wouldn\u2019t feel real without it.Tom Vanderbilt writes on design, technology, science, and culture, among other subjects.\n          \n            ADVERTISEMENT\n            \n            \n      \n        Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. \n        \n          Log in\n         \n        or \n        \n          Join now\n        .\n      \n          References 1.

I\u2019m not even talking about documantation and testing that is a complete different story. Even a month old example code often becomes broken and you need to search over change logs to figure out what\u2019s changed.For the sake of stability, please make sure that you are doing versioning right.Semantic VersioningSemVer is very popular and the most misused software versioning scheme in javascript universe.Yes! I said \u201cmisused\u201d. Because many popular javascript libraries or let me correct it, many contributors of popular javascript libraries usually do not care or break the rules of the semantic versioning.Ok, enough complaining and lets learn and do it right.In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly become a nightmare. As a solution to this problem, SemVer proposes a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:PATCH: Bug fixes and other minor changes: Patch release, increment the last number, e.g. 0.0.1MINOR: New features which don\u2019t break existing features: Minor release, increment the middle number, e.g. 0.1.0MAJOR: Changes which break backwards compatibility: Major release, increment the first number, e.g. 1.0.0Ps: All packages in npm have to follow the rules above.It\u2019s easy, right?Next time you get a minor change in a package uses SemVer and breaks your code. Open a bug report and make them know what is broken and why.",

But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.\nAccording to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided \u2014 we\u2019re talking worse than those in China, in some cases \u2014 that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.\nAs many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year\u2019s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of \u201cNorth African or Arabic\u201d descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave. Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?\nIt makes good sense that so many young men are leaving countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria: Their demographic is often at greater risk of being coerced into joining fighting groups, or being killed rather than captured by such groups. But the result is that 66.26 percent of adult migrants registered through Italy and Greece over the past year were male, according to the International Organization of Migration.\nThat imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It\u2019s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors \u2014 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.\nTo see how these overall figures affect specific countries \u2014 and why there is reason for concern \u2014 consider the case of Sweden, which has been especially transparent about its migration statistics and whose ratios mirror the broader trend in Europe in many respects.\nA group of refugees, led by Turkish police, are escorted to buses in place of sailing to the Greek island of Chios via raft, at a beach in the western Turkish coastal town of Cesme, in Izmir province, on November 5, 2015. Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty\n\nAccording to Swedish government statistics, as of the end of November, 71 percent of all applicants for asylum to Sweden in 2015 were male. More than 21 percent of all migrants to Sweden were classified as unaccompanied minors, representing more than half of all minor migrants to the country. For accompanied minors, the sex ratio was about 1.16 boys for every one girl. But for unaccompanied minors, the ratio was 11.3 boys for every one girl. In other words, the Swedish case confirms IOM\u2019s statistic that more than 90 percent of unaccompanied minors are male. Indeed, on average, approximately 90 unaccompanied boys entered Sweden every single day in 2015, compared with eight unaccompanied girls.\nThose numbers are a recipe for striking imbalances within Sweden. Consider that more than half of these unaccompanied minors entering Sweden are 16 or 17 years old, or at least claim to be. (There are no medical checks of age for Swedish asylum-seekers, and applicants who say they\u2019re under 18 receive special consideration in the asylum process.) In this age group more than three-quarters are unaccompanied, meaning they are overwhelmingly male. According to calculations based on the Swedish government\u2019s figures, a total of 18,615 males aged 16 and 17 entered Sweden over the course of the past year, compared with 2,555 females of the same age. Sure enough, when those figures are added to the existing counts of 16- and 17-year-old boys and girls in Sweden\u2014103,299 and 96,524, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s International Database\u2014you end up with a total of 121,914 males in Sweden aged 16 or 17 and 99,079 females of the same age. The resulting ratio is astonishing: These calculations suggest that as of the end of 2015, there were 123 16- and 17-year-old boys in Sweden for every 100 girls of that age.\nIf that trend continues into 2016 or even beyond, each successive late adolescent cohort of 16- and 17-year-olds will be similarly abnormal, and over time the abnormality will become an established fact of the broader young adult population in Sweden. (Hans Rosling, the Swedish data visualizer who created the GapMinder Foundation, has similar estimates regarding the alteration of Swedish sex ratios.) In China, long the most gender-imbalanced country in the world, the male-to-female ratio of approximately 117 boys for every 100 girls in this age group now comes up short of Sweden\u2019s gender gap. China\u2019s sex ratios are still more abnormal across other age groups; the imbalances there extend all the way down to birth sex ratios due to the country\u2019s severe birth restrictions, while Sweden\u2019s abnormalities do not. But young adult sex ratios are arguably the most crucial of all for social stability.\nCanada is the one country so far that seems to think this is cause for concern. Faced with similarly skewed sex ratios among asylum-seekers, the new liberal administration of Justin Trudeau announced in late November that, starting in 2016, it would accept only women, accompanied children and families from Syria. Specifically excluded would be unaccompanied minor males and single adult males (unless they are members of the LGBTQ community); those excluded will primarily be older teen and young adult men.\nFear of terrorism could well be part of Canada\u2019s calculus, especially in the wake of attacks perpetrated by migrants in Europe and the United States; in the overwhelming majority of cases, terror attacks are carried out by unattached young adult men. Most of these men are unmarried, and virtually none have children. Indeed, the Islamic State reportedly discourages its male fighters from having children so that they are more willing to engage in suicide attacks, and widows of suicide bombers are quickly forced to remarry, while remaining on birth control.\nBut fear of terrorism might not be the only reason to be leery of highly abnormal sex ratios among the young adult population. As my co-author Andrea Den Boer and I argued in our book, societies with extremely skewed sex ratios are more unstable even without jihadi ideologues in their midst. Numerous empirical studies have shown that sex ratios correlate significantly with violence and property crime\u2014the higher the sex ratio, the worse the crime rate. Our research also found a link between sex ratios and the emergence of both violent criminal gangs and anti-government movements. It makes sense: When young adult males fail to make the transition to starting a household\u2014particularly those young males who are already at risk for sociopathic behavior due to marginalization, a common concern among immigrants\u2014their grievances are aggravated.\nThere are also clearly negative effects for women in male-dominated populations. Crimes such as rape and sexual harassment become more common in highly masculinized societies, and women\u2019s ability to move about freely and without fear within society is curtailed. In addition, demand for prostitution soars; that would create a deeply ironic outcome for Sweden, which invented the path-breaking Swedish abolitionist approach to prostitution.\nSweden\u2019s foreign minister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m. Ilmars Znotins/AFP/Getty\n\nEurope is famously progressive on women\u2019s rights, and some European governments have even created voluntary classes for migrants to understand how the treatment of women may be profoundly different in their new homes. But even with such efforts there is the potential for real regress when the young adult sex ratio is so high. And what is often invisible in the debates over migration is that the women left behind by this largely male exodus are usually left in dire situations: In displaced persons camps in Syria or refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan and surrounding countries, female-headed households live in fear and penury, prey to exploitation and abuse. Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m rightly emphasizes her country\u2019s \u201cfeminist foreign policy\u201d\u2014but can Sweden really consider its migration policy to be feminist?\nWhile the humanitarian needs of the refugees streaming into Europe must be foremost in our minds at this time, policymakers in Sweden and other countries should also think of the long-term consequences of an unprecedented alteration in the young adult sex ratios of their societies. The Canadian approach should be carefully studied, and perhaps adapted by other countries. After all, if the sex ratios of the migrants\u2019 countries of origins are balanced, is it not odd to accept predominantly male migrants for asylum?\nAs anthropologist Barbara Miller has persuasively argued, a normal sex ratio is a \u201cpublic good\u201d and therefore deserves state protection. For Sweden\u2014or any other European country\u2014to wind up with the worst young adult sex ratios in the world would be a tragedy for European men and women alike.\nValerie Hudson is professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University and co-author, most recently, of The Hillary Doctrine: Sex and American Foreign Policy.\n     Also On POLITICO            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "original_score": 5,
    "rm_score_original": 1.234375,
    "scraped_body": "The real reason online advertising is doomed and adblockers thrive? Its malware epidemic is unacknowledged, and out of control.The Forbes 30 Under 30 list came out this week and it featured a prominent security researcher. Other researchers were pleased to see one of their own getting positive attention, and visited the site in droves to view the list.On arrival, like a growing number of websites, Forbes asked readers to turn off ad blockers in order to view the article. After doing so, visitors were immediately served with pop-under malware, primed to infect their computers, and likely silently steal passwords, personal data and banking information. Or, as is popular worldwide with these malware \"exploit kits,\" lock up their hard drives in exchange for Bitcoin ransom.One researcher commented on Twitter that the situation was \"ironic\" -- and while it's certainly another variant of hackenfreude, ironic isn't exactly the word I'd use to describe what happened. That's because this situation spotlights what happened in 2015 to billions -- yep, billions -- of people who were victims of virus-infected ads which were spread via ad networks like germs from a sneeze across the world's most popular websites. Less than a month ago, a bogus banner ad was found serving malvertising to visitors of video site DailyMotion. After discovering it, security company Malwarebytes contacted the online ad platform the bad ad was coming through, Atomx. The company blamed a \"rogue\" advertiser on the WWPromoter network.It was estimated the adware broadcast through DailyMotion put 128 million people at risk. To be specific, it was from the notorious malware family called \"Angler Exploit Kit.\" Remember this name, because I'm pretty sure we're going to be getting to know it a whole lot better in 2016.Last August, Angler struck MSN.com with -- you guessed it -- another drive-by malvertising campaign. It was the same campaign that had infected Yahoo visitors back in July (an estimated 6.9 billion visits per month, it's considered the biggest malvertising attack so far).October saw Angler targeting Daily Mail visitors through poisoned ads as well (monthly ad impressions 64.4 million). Only last month, Angler's malicious ads hit visitors to Reader's Digest (210K readers; ad impressions 1.7M). That attack sat unattended after being in the press, and was fixed only after a week of public outcry.It's crazy to consider what a perfect marriage this is, between the advertisers and the criminals pushing the exploit kits. They have a lot in common.Both try to trick us into giving them something we don't want to. We've recently learned that both entities surveil and track us beyond what we're OK with. And both are hard to get rid of. You know, like those gross toenail and skin condition ad-banners found at the bottom of every cheapo blog you've ever seen, forever burned into the \"can't unsee\" section of your brain.It actually makes business sense to think about malware attacks like an advertiser. You want to deliver your infection to, and scrape those dollars from, every little reader out there. You need a targeted delivery system, with the widest distribution, and as many clueless middlemen as possible.It's easy to want to blame Reader's Digest, or Yahoo, or Forbes, or Daily Mail, or any of these sites for screwing viewers by serving them malicious ads and not telling them, or not helping them with the cleanup afterward. And it's a hell of a lot easier when they've compelled us to turn off our ad blockers to simply see what brought us to their site.But the problem is coming through them, from the ad networks themselves. The same ones, it should be mentioned, who control the Faustian bargains made by bartering and selling our information.What should the websites do? The ad networks clearly don't have a handle on this at all, giving us one more reason to use ad blockers. They're practically the most popular malware delivery systems on Earth, and they're making the websites they do business with into the same poisonous monster. I don't even want to think about what it all means for the security practices of the ad companies handling our tracking data or the sites we visit hosting these pathogens.So, to my friend on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list -- a malware researcher, which I'll concede is actually ironic -- I'm sorry I won't be seeing your time in that particular spotlight. What we need is a word for the fact that ad blockers have become our first line of defense against a malware epidemic. Especially during a time when the sites we visit are begging, pleading, demanding and practically tricking us into turning off Ad Block Plus.[Image credit: Getty Images]",

Today, the Cardinals former director of baseball development plead guilty to five charges of unauthorized access of a protected computer after accessing the Houston Astros' player files without permission.As part of a plea agreement, Christopher Correa admitted that he looked at the Astros' so-called Ground Control database and email accounts beginning March 2013 and lasting for a period of at least a year. Ground Control was a password-protected online database were confidential payer details like scouting reports, stats and contract information was stored. The FBI says that no other Cardinals employees were involved in the hack.

    "scraped_body": "\n                        Imperva Incapsula\u2019s annual Bot Traffic Report, now in its fourth year, is a statistical study of the typically imperceptible bot traffic landscape.\nMuch has changed in the general understanding of bots since we first revealed them to be responsible for the bulk of all website traffic. Today, it is not uncommon to find entire articles (including our own) dedicated to the study of individual bots: their HTTP footprints, points of origin and the nuances of their behavior.\nCollectively, however, these non-humans are still discussed in terms of two archetypes: Good Bots and Bad Bots.\nGood bots are the worker bees of the Internet that assist its evolution and growth. Their owners are legitimate businesses who use bots to assist with automated tasks, including data collection and website scanning.\nBad bots, on the other hand, are the malicious intruders that swarm the Internet and leave a trail of hacked websites and downed services. Their masters are the bad actors of the cyber-security world, from career hackers to script kiddies. In their hands, bots are used to automate spam campaigns, spy on competitors, launch denial of service (DDoS) attacks or execute vulnerability scans to compromise websites on a large scale.\nIn the past, good and bad bots have always been responsible for most of the activity on our network. This year, however, we saw a changing of the guard, with humans stepping in to become the Internet\u2019s new majority.\n\nHow Humans Are Taking Back the Web\nWhen analyzing our data, we were very surprised to find out that, for the first time, humans were the ones responsible for the majority (51.5 percent) of all online traffic.\nThese numbers initially appeared to be a complete trend reversal. However, upon closer inspection, and when put in the context of our previous analyses, they actually signaled the continuation of a trend, which consists of:\n\nAn increase in the relative amount of human traffic, from 38.5% in 2013 to 51.5% in 2015.\nA decrease in the relative amount of good bot traffic, from 31% in 2013 to 19.5% in 2015.\nA static amount of bad bot traffic, which fluctuates around 30%.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note here is that all of these numbers are relative. This means that each of the groups is only able to grow at the expense of another. It is also important to mention that\u2014in absolute terms\u2014the sheer amount of bot and human traffic on our network is always increasing.\nSo, the question here is not: Why are good bots becoming less active? But, rather: Why aren\u2019t they keeping up with the other two groups?\nTo answer that, we drilled deeper into our data and this is what we found out:\n1. Across-the-Board Decline\nOur first assumption was that the downtrend in good bot traffic could be attributed to an individual bot, or group of bots, as was seen with RSS bots last year. To test this theory, we performed a year-over-year comparison of all good bot clients.\nTo our surprise, the comparison showed that the downtrend occurred across the board, with 442 of the 484 good bot clients displaying negative growth or an extremely low growth of less than 0.01 percent. Individually, none of them declined by more than two percent.\nMoreover, out of 42 good bots that displayed increased activity, only one displayed an increase of more than one percent.\nBasically, what we had here was a case of good bots collectively not keeping up with growth of human and bad bot traffic.\n2. Can\u2019t Keep Up on Popular Sites\nOur next step was to look more closely at the websites in our sample group.\nLast year, we segmented those sites based on the number of daily visits they received, with the intention of helping website owners better understand their own bot situation. This year, we decided to go back to those stats, using them as a basis for a year-over-year analysis.\nOur goal? To see if the decline in bot traffic was especially steep for any of those website groups.\nThe effort paid off. What we saw was an asymmetric decrease in bot traffic, with traffic to smaller and mid-sized websites actually trending up, while the traffic to larger and more popular websites trending down.\nMost prominently, we saw that bot traffic to the most popular websites (those with 100,000 daily visits or more) went down from 54.3 percent to 39.7 percent.\n\nNext we zoomed in and looked at good/bad bot traffic. There, we saw that a year-over-year decline in good bot traffic occurred solely on the high-tier websites.\nMost prominently, we noticed that on websites with 100,000 or more daily human visits, good bot activity went down from 21.9 percent to 9.3 percent. This, interestingly enough, was in contrast to activity on low-tier websites, where good bot traffic actually went up.\n\nSo, we had our \u201csmoking gun\u201d. It appeared that the more popular a website got, the harder it was for the good bots to keep up with the influx of human and bad bot visits.\nA Question of Motivation\nTo understand why good bots do not frequent popular sites as often as humans, it is important to consider the motivations that drive good bot traffic.\nBroadly speaking, there are two main reasons behind the visit of every good bot:\n\nIndiscriminate crawls \u2013 These consist of various crawlers, including search engine bots, marketing research tools (e.g., backlink checkers), legitimate scrapers (e.g., WayBackMachine bot) and so on. These crawlers do not target your website specifically. Your site is one of many domains they keep track of on a regular basis.\nTargeted scans \u2013 These involve you, or someone interested in your website, using a piece of software to initiate a targeted scan (e.g., uptime monitors, vulnerability scanners, SEO tools, etc.).\n\nIn both cases, high website popularity is unlikely to translate into increased good bot traffic.\nFor instance, one of our previous studies already showed that there is no correlation between website\u2019s popularity and the amount of Google bot visits. This is also the case for the majority of crawlers. And while it\u2019s reasonable to think that a popular website will draw more targeted scans, the number of extra sessions generated are negligible.\nBut while good bots are agnostic to popular content, humans are not. In fact, the more popular a website gets, the faster its human population tends to grow\u2014its accelerated growth supported by repeated visits and virality, the latter powered by the (also) constantly growing social media.\nFurthermore, the population of humans on the Internet is consistently growing, as evidenced by the roughly 8.1 percent uptick over the last year in the graph below. Meanwhile, the time we spend online has increased as well.\n\nWorldwide Internet population, in millions of users (source)\nThe compound effect of these growth trends, and the fact that only humans are motivated to consume and share popular content, are the reason why good bots\u2014 who lack the same motivations\u2014simply can\u2019t keep up.\n\n\n\nBad Bots Are as Active as Ever\nIn light of the above-mentioned trends, it is interesting to note that we saw no decrease in bad bot activity, neither on smaller or more popular websites.\nThere are several key reasons for this:\n\nUnlike good bots, malicious non-humans are often employed by individuals or small criminal groups, not organizations. As a result, their growth is more closely tied to the increase in Internet human population.\nFor every Internet user in the developed world, there are two in developing countries. Industry reports, including our own, repeatedly show these countries to be the hubs of botnet activity, indicating a wider availability of under-secured connected devices.\nDDoS tools and DDoS-for-hire services that cause an influx in DDoS traffic are widely available. Recently, we saw this lead to a 121.9 percent quarter-over-quarter increase in the amount of DDoS bots, categorized here as \u2018Impersonators\u2019. Not surprisingly, this is also the only bot group that has displayed consistent growth over the last four years.\n\n\nAs a result, websites of all sizes are as targeted as ever, and are visited on average by one malicious non-human for every two humans.\nThese bots continue to pose a serious threat to the Internet ecosystem. The extent of this threat is such that, on any given day, over 90 percent of all security events on our network are the result of bad bot activity. From the looks of it, these are not going away any time soon.\n\nLearning from Spam Bots\nSo what can be done to minimize the threat posed by malicious bots? Individually, website operators can counter malicious bots with security solutions, like our own, which offer protection from application layer attacks. These include automated hacking attempts, scraping, spamming and DDoS attacks.\nOn a larger scale, however, security solutions can only treat the symptoms of the actual problem, which is a rapid expansion of botnets, leading to growing amounts of automated attacks.\nWhile it would be na\u00efve to assume that such malicious activity can be completely eradicated, there are ways to limit the motivations that drive its growth. To us, this is the moral of the story of Spambots; a group of malicious bots that saw a radical decline, from two percent in 2012 to 0.1 percent in 2015.\n\nOnce again, it all boils down to motivation.\nPrior to 2012, spambots were commonly employed by Black Hat SEOs who used them to auto-inject links across dozens, hundreds or even thousands of domains at a time. The incentive was the SEO boost the spam links provided, which helped the linked domain climb higher in search engine result pages (SERP).\nThings changed in April 2012, when Google stepped up its war against Spam by introducing the first of its Penguin updates. The change in the algorithm penalized all websites involved in spam distribution\u2014not only those who profited from spam links, but also those who hosted them.\nWith this new proactive approach, Google turned link spam into a high risk/low reward activity. More importantly, it motivated website operators to harden their anti-spam measures to prevent being penalized for allowing spam links on their websites.\nThis zero-tolerance approach, which promotes security awareness and individual responsibility should be applied to other aspects of online activity.\nFor example, industry standards could be used to enforce hardened security of connected devices, the negligent handling of which often leads to the creation of botnets that spawn malicious bot traffic. On the other end, legal action and consumer movements could promote a no-negotiation policy with cyber-extortionists, taking away one of the main motivations for hacker activity.\nThis year, for the first time ever, concerns about botnet activity were voiced by the White House. We also witnessed the prosecution of high-profile botnet operators. While these are unlikely to deter other perpetrators, such steps are important to promote awareness and guide a discussion on the topic of malicious bots, their origin, MO and damage potential.\nWhat\u2019s still missing are ground rules that can be adopted by the private and governmental sectors. These rules need to define how the botnet threat should be address and contained, if not resolved.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe data presented herein is based on a sample of over 19 billion human and bot visits occurring over a 90-day period, from July 24, 2015 to October 21, 2015. It was collected from 35,000 Incapsula-protected websites having a minimum daily traffic count of at least 10 human visitors.\nYear-over-year comparison relies on data collected for the previous Bot Traffic Report, consisting of a sample of over 15 billion human and bot visits occurring over a 90-day period, from August 2, 2014 to October 30, 2014. That sample was collected from 20,000 Incapsula-protected websites having a minimum daily traffic count of at least 10 human visitors.\nGeographically, the observed traffic includes all of the world\u2019s 249 countries, territories, or areas of geographical interest (per codes provided by an ISO 3166-1 standard).\nThe analysis was powered by the Incapsula Client Classification engine\u2014a proprietary technology relying on cross-verification of such factors as HTTP fingerprint, IP address origin, and behavioral patterns to identify and classify incoming web traffic. Our Client Classification engine is deployed on all Incapsula-protected websites as part of the company\u2019s multi-tier security solution.\n\nWant to learn more about bots?\nVisit these links to learn more about:\n\nWhat is an Internet bot\nWhat is a botnet\nOur bot filtering process\nLatest DDoS botnet activity\nFake Googlebot attacks\nThe most active good crawlers\n\n\n\n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                                    Try Imperva for Free\n                                Protect your business for 30 days on Imperva.\n            \n                Start Now\n                                        \n                                            ",

    "scraped_body": "\n                    In layman's terms, a backdoor is usually something a computer criminal leaves behind in your system after they've broken in the first time, to save them the trouble of breaking in the hard way in the future.\nHowever, backdoors can be also be an intentional security vulnerability inserted into software projects with the hopes that doing so will give the attacker access to your system. See also: Juniper.\nWe're going to talk about the second type of backdoor.\n\nThere is some programming ahead, but if you can't read code just skip the code blocks and I'll explain what's going on afterwards.\n\nThe Underhanded Crypto Contest\nStarting in 2015, the Crypto & Privacy Village at the DEFCON Hacking Conference is the home to the Underhanded Crypto Contest, a competition to discover and document the best ways to subtly subvert crypto code (and a cryptography focused spiritual successor to the Underhanded C Contest). At DEFCON 23 there were two tracks to this contest:\n\nBackdoor GnuPG.\nBackdoor password authentication.\n\nI submitted an entry into the second track (and won). I'm going to explain how my entry works, what tricks I employed to make it plausibly deniable, and some of its immediate implications on software development.\nHow We Designed Our Password Authentication Backdoor\nBefore I begin, let me say something to any government employees who find this blog post years from now and is considering hiring Paragon Initiative Enterprises to implement a backdoor (or \"secure golden key\" as they like to call it): We're not interested.\nStep One: Fabricate an Excellent Cover Story\nRight before DEFCON 23, cryptographer Scott Contini posted a blog post about user account enumeration via exploiting timing side-channels, which work like this:\n\nYou are attempting to log in to the web app with a username and password.\nIs the username registered? If yes, continue. Otherwise, say \"bad username/password\".\nVerify the password, which is probably properly hashed with bcrypt; otherwise say \"bad username/password\".\nIf step 3 proceeds, the user is authenticated.\n\nFailing at step two will take measurably less time (from an attacker's perspective) than failing at step three. By doing so, an attacker can send a bunch of requests and figure out valid usernames, even if the rest of the application is secure.\nTiming leaks are a back door gold mine. Most developers don't understand them, and most information security professionals are not programmers. Even if you write obviously insecure cryptography-related code, most developers will probably OK it because they don't know better. But the contest would have been boring if we did that.\nSo far, our master plan looks like this:\n\nPropose a solution that pretends to solve the \"account enumeration via timing attacks\" vulnerability.\nHide a backdoor in our solution.\nMake sure a casual review from an average developer wouldn't raise any red flags.\n\nStep Two: The Design Phase\nThe TimingSafeAuth class is reproduced here, in its entirety:\n<?php\n\n/**\n * A password_* wrapper that is proactively secure against user enumeration from\n * the timing difference between a valid user (which runs through the\n * password_verify() function) and an invalid user (which does not).\n */\nclass TimingSafeAuth\n{\n    private $db;\n    public function __construct(\\PDO $db)\n    {\n        $this->db = $db;\n        $this->dummy_pw = password_hash(noise(), PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Authenticate a user without leaking valid usernames through timing\n     * side-channels\n     *\n     * @param string $username\n     * @param string $password\n     * @return int|false\n     */\n    public function authenticate($username, $password)\n    {\n        $stmt = $this->db->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username\");\n        if ($stmt->execute(['username' => $username])) {\n            $row = $stmt->fetch(\\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n            // Valid username\n            if (password_verify($password, $row['password'])) {\n                return $row['userid'];\n            }\n            return false;\n        } else {\n            // Returns false\n            return password_verify($password, $this->dummy_pw);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen the TimingSafeAuth class is instantiated, it unavoidably creates a \"dummy password\", derived from a function called noise() (adapted from AnchorCMS, defined below):\n/**\n * Generate a random string with our specific charset, which conforms to the\n * RFC 4648 standard for BASE32 encoding.\n *\n * @return string\n */\nfunction noise()\n{\n    return substr(\n        str_shuffle(str_repeat('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567', 16)),\n        0,\n        32\n    );\n}\n\n\nKeep this noise() function in mind; it's a key piece of the backdoor.\n\nAfter we have an instantiated TimingSafeAuth object available to whatever login script needs it, it will eventually pass a username and password to TimingSafeAuth->authenticate(), which will perform a database lookup then do one of two things:\n\nIf the username was found, validate the provided password with the bcrypt hash on file for the user (using password_verify())\nOtherwise, invoke password_verify() with the provided password and the dummy bcrypt hash.\n\nSince $this->dummy_pw is the bcrypt hash of a randomly generated string, we can always expect option 2 to fail and return false, but it will always take about the same amount of time (thus hiding the timing side-channel), right?\nVulnerabilities Hidden in Plain Sight\nOkay, the biggest lie is hidden right here:\n// Returns false\nreturn password_verify($password, $this->dummy_pw);\n\nThis doesn't always return false. If an attacker somehow guessed the dummy password that went into $this->dummy_pw, this would return true! A correct implementation would be:\npassword_verify($password, $this->dummy_pw);\nreturn false;\n\nBut let's say the auditor gives this the benefit of the doubt. \"If the dummy password was hard-coded, this would be a concern, but it's randomly generated so it's totally safe, right?\"\nNOPE! str_shuffle() isn't a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. To understand why it's not, you have to look at how str_shuffle() is implemented in PHP:\nstatic void php_string_shuffle(char *str, zend_long len) /* {{{ */\n{\n    zend_long n_elems, rnd_idx, n_left;\n    char temp;\n    /* The implementation is stolen from array_data_shuffle       */\n    /* Thus the characteristics of the randomization are the same */\n    n_elems = len;\n\n    if (n_elems <= 1) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    n_left = n_elems;\n\n    while (--n_left) {\n        rnd_idx = php_rand();\n        RAND_RANGE(rnd_idx, 0, n_left, PHP_RAND_MAX);\n        if (rnd_idx != n_left) {\n            temp = str[n_left];\n            str[n_left] = str[rnd_idx];\n            str[rnd_idx] = temp;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSee the line that says rnd_idx = php_rand();? That's rand(), a trivially crackable linear-congruent generator. (See also: this StackOverflow answer.)\nSo, for a quick recap:\n\nIf you guess the dummy password, the TimingSafeAuth->authenticate() method will return true\n\nThe dummy password is generated by an insecure and predictable random number generator (taken from a real-world PHP project)\nOnly developers intimately familiar with cryptography and PHP's internals would realize that this is dangerous\n\nThis is useful, but not quite exploitable. Let's gift-wrap our intentional vulnerability in the implementation phase.\nStep Three: Implementing the Backdoor\nOur login form looks like this (comments preceded with a # were added by us in this post, and were not part of the contest entry):\n<?php\n# This is all just preamble stuff, ignore it.\nrequire_once dirname(__DIR__).'/autoload.php';\n$pdo = new \\PDO('sqlite:'. dirname(__DIR__) . '/database.sql');\nsession_start();\n\n# Start here\nif (!isset($_SESSION['userid'])) {\n    # If you aren't currently logged in...\n    if (!empty($_POST['csrf']) && !empty($_COOKIE['csrf'])) {\n        # If you sent a CSRF token in the POST form data and a CSRF cookie\n        if (hash_equals($_POST['csrf'], $_COOKIE['csrf'])) {\n            # And they match (compared in constant time!), proceed\n            $auth = new TimingSafeAuth($pdo);\n            # Pass the given username and password to the authenticate() method.\n            $userid = (int) $auth->authenticate($_POST['username'], $_POST['password']);\n            # Take note of the type cast to (int).\n            if ($userid) {\n                // Success!\n                $_SESSION['userid'] = $userid;\n                header(\"Location: /\");\n                exit;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    # This is the login form:\n    require_once dirname(__DIR__).'/secret/login_form.php';\n} else {\n    # This is where you want to be:\n    require_once dirname(__DIR__).'/secret/login_successful.php';\n}\n\nAnd now for the last code block (login_form.php, the code that generates the login form for an unauthenticated user):\n<?php\nif (!isset($_COOKIE['csrf'])) {\n    # Remember this?\n    $csrf = noise();\n    setcookie('csrf', $csrf);\n} else {\n    $csrf = $_COOKIE['csrf'];\n}\n?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Log In</title>\n    <!-- # Below: We leak rand(); but that's totally benign, right? -->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/style.css?<?=rand(); ?>\" type=\"text/css\" /><?php /* cache-busting random query string */ ?>\n</head>\n<body>\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"/\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf\" value=\"<?=htmlentities($csrf, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8'); ?>\" />\n    <table>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <fieldset>\n                    <legend>Username</legend>\n                    <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" required=\"required\" />\n                </fieldset>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <fieldset>\n                    <legend>Password</legend>\n                    <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" required=\"required\" />\n                </fieldset>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td colsan=\"2\">\n                <button type=\"submit\">\n                    Log In\n                </button>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n</form>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nSo, this does a lot of little things, outside of being a perfectly normal password form. It includes basic CSRF protection (generated, once again, by noise()). Each time you load the page without a cookie, it gives you the output of noise() as a new CSRF cookie.\nWhile that alone should be sufficient to figure out the random number generator seed and predict the dummy password, we go ahead and leak a single rand() output in a query string for the stylesheet (while claiming its purpose is to to bust caches). Instead, the new CSRF cookie is useful for determining if the noise() prediction is successful without registering a failed authentication attempt (not that we're logging those in this code anyway).\nSee the line that reads $userid = (int) $auth->authenticate($_POST['username'], $_POST['password']);? This is the other piece of our backdoor. PHP will set true to 1 when you cast it to an integer. Lower user IDs, especially 1, are typically associated with administrative accounts in web applications.\nThe Exploit\nPutting all of the above information together, exploiting this is actually rather straightforward:\n\nSend a few benign requests to the login form, \"forgetting\" the CSRF cookie each time and taking note of the query string that follows style.css in the HTML.\nWhen you can accurately predict the next CSRF cookie, don't forget it. Instead, supply it as the password for a randomly chosen username (sufficiently random that it's guaranteed to not be a valid user)\nEnjoy being logged in as userid = 1.\n\nWhat are the Implications of this Backdoor?\nDevelopers shouldn't be in such a rush to solve security problems they don't fully comprehend. Although I crafted this as a contest entry for designing backdoored cryptosystems, every decision I made could plausibly have been made by a developer in a hurry to fix this security problem that a renowned cryptographer blogged about. (One of them was even taken, almost verbatim, from Anchor CMS.)\nNovel solutions to hard problems should be reviewed by an expert. If we had never entered this contest, and someone had implemented this code in one of their projects then hired Paragon to audit their application, we would have spotted this immediately and wrote a patch to mitigate it. But we also specialize in application security, cryptography, and PHP development.\nUser enumeration is a very hard problem to solve. Even if TimingSafeAuth weren't backdoored, the database lookup almost certainly isn't constant-time, so there's still a timing leak. (As a rule: No optimized search operations are done in constant-time.)\nUser enumeration also might not even be a problem worth solving. In my personal opinion, making passwords more secure (or abstracting them away entirely, with something SQRL or TLS client certificates) is a more laudable goal. Password managers help!\n            ",

    "original_score": 2,
    "rm_score_original": 1.34375,
    "scraped_body": "\nThe most important thing for humanity to do right now is to invent true artificial intelligence (AI): machines or software that can think and act independently in a wide variety of situations. Once we have artificial intelligence, it can help us solve all manner of other problems.\n\nLuckily, thousands of researchers around work on inventing artificial intelligence. While most of them work on ways of using known AI algorithms to solve new problems, some work on the overarching problem of artificial general intelligence. I do both. As I see it, addressing applied problems spur the invention of new algorithms, and the availability of new algorithms make it possible to address new problems. Having concrete problems to try to solve with AI is necessary in order to make progress; if you try to invent AI without having something to use it for, you will not know where to start. My chosen domain is games, and I will explain why this is the most relevant domain to work on if you are serious about AI.\n\nI talk about this a lot. All the time, some would say.\n\n\nBut first, let us acknowledge that AI has gotten a lot of attention recently, in particular work on \"deep learning\" is being discussed in mainstream press as well as turned into startups that get bought by giant companies for bizarre amounts of money. There have been some very impressive advances during the past few years in identifying objects in images, understanding speech, matching names to faces, translating text and other such tasks. By some measures, the winner of the recent ImageNet contest is better than humans at correctly naming things in images; sometimes I think Facebook's algorithms are better than me at recognizing the faces of my acquaintances.\n\nExample image from the ImageNet competition. \"Deep\" neural networks have been made to learn to label images extremely well lately. Image courtesy of image-net.org.\n\n\nWith few exceptions, the tasks that deep neural networks have excelled at are what are called pattern recognition problems. Basically, take some large amount of data (an image, a song, a text) and output some other (typically smaller) data, such as a name, a category, another image or a text in another language. To learn to do this, they look at tons of data to find patterns. In other words, the neural networks are learning to do the same work as our brain's sensory systems: sight, hearing, touch and so on. To a lesser extent they can also do some of the job of our brain's language centra.\n\nHowever, this is not all that intelligence is. We humans don't just sit around and watch things all day. We do things: solve problems by taking decisions and carrying them out. We move about and we manipulate our surroundings. (Sure, some days we stay in bed almost all day, but most of the rest of the time we are active in one way or another.) Our intelligence evolved to help us survive in a hostile environment, and doing that meant both reacting to the world and planning complicated sequences of actions, as well as adapting to changing circumstances. Pattern recognition - identifying objects and faces, understanding speech and so on - is an important component of intelligence, but should really be thought of as one part of a complete system which is constantly working on figuring out what to do next. Trying to invent artificial intelligence while only focusing on pattern recognition is like trying to invent the car while only focusing on the wheels.\n\nIn order to build a complete artificial intelligence we therefore need to build a system that takes actions in some kind of environment. How can we do this? Perhaps the most obvious idea is to embody artificial intelligence in robots. And indeed, robotics has shown us how even the most mundane tasks, such as walking in terrain or grabbing strangely shaped objects, are really rather hard to accomplish for robots. In the eighties, robotics research largely refocused on these kind of \"simple\" problems, which led to progress in applications as well as a better understanding of what intelligence is all about. The last few decades of progress in robotics has fed into the development of self-driving cars, which is likely to become one of the areas where AI technology will revolutionize society in the near future.\n\nOnce upon a time, when I thought I was a roboticist of sorts. The carlike robot in the foreground was supposed to learn to independently drive around the University of Essex campus (in the background). I think it's fair to say we underestimated the problem. (From left to right: me (now at NYU), Renzo de Nardi (Google), Simon Lucas (Essex), Richard Newcombe (Facebook/Oculus), Hugo Marques (ETH Zurich).)\n\n\nNow, working with robots clearly has its downsides. Robots are expensive, complex and slow. When I started my PhD, my plan was to build robot software that would learn evolutionarily from its mistakes in order to develop increasingly complex and general intelligence. But I soon realized that in order for my robots to learn from their experiences, they would have to attempt each task thousands of times, with each attempt maybe taking a few minutes. This meant that even a simple experiment would take several days - even if the robot would not break down (it usually would) or start behaving differently as the batteries depleted or motors warmed up. In order to learn any more complex intelligence I would have to build an excessively complex (and expensive) robot with advanced sensors and actuators, further increasing the risk of breakdown. I also would have to develop some very complex environments where complex skills could be learned. This all adds up, and quickly becomes unmanageable. Problems such as these is why the field of evolutionary robotics has not scaled up to evolve more complex intelligence.\n\nThe basic idea of evolutionary robotics: use Darwinian evolution implemented as a computer algorithm to teach robot AIs (for example neural networks) to solve tasks. Image taken from a recent survey paper.\n\n\nI was too ambitious and impatient for that. I wanted to create complex intelligence that could learn from experience. So I turned to video games.\n\nGames and artificial intelligence have a long history together. Even since before artificial intelligence was recognized as a field, early pioneers of computer science wrote game-playing programs because they wanted to test whether computers could solve tasks that seemed to require \"intelligence\". Alan Turing, arguably the principal inventor of computer science, (re)invented the Minimax algorithm and used it to play Chess. (As no computer had been built yet, he performed the calculations himself using pen and paper.) Arthur Samuel was the first to invent the form of machine learning that is now called reinforcement learning; he used it in a program that learned to play Checkers by playing against itself. Much later, IBM's Deep Blue computer famously won against the reigning grandmaster of Chess, Gary Kasparov, in a much-publicized 1997 event. Currently, many researchers around the world work on developing better software for playing the board game Go, where the best software is still no match for the best humans.\n\nArthur Samuel in 1957, playing checkers against a mainframe computer the size of a room and thousands of times less computer power than your phone. The computer won.\u00a0\n\n\nClassic board game such as Chess, Checkers and Go are nice and easy to work with as they are very simple to model in code and can be simulated extremely fast - you could easily make millions of moves per second on a modern computer - which is indispensable for many AI techniques. Also, they seem to require thinking to play well, and have the property that they take \"a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master\". It is indeed the case that games have a lot to do with learning, and good games are able to constantly teach us more about how to play them. Indeed, to some extent the fun in playing a game consists in learning it and when there is nothing more to learn we largely stop enjoying them. This suggests that better-designed games are also better benchmarks for artificial intelligence. However, judging from the fact that now have (relatively simple) computer programs that can play Chess better than any human, it is clear that you don't need to be truly, generally intelligent to play such games well. When you think about it, they exercise only a very narrow range of human thinking skills; it's all about turn-based movements on a discrete grid of a few pieces with very well-defined, deterministic behavior.\n\nDeep Blue beats Kasparov in Chess.\n\n\n\nBut, despite what your grandfather might want you to believe, there's more to games than classical board games. In addition to all kinds of modern boundary-pushing board games, card games and role-playing games, there's also video games. Video games owe their massive popularity at least partly to that they engage multiple senses and multiple cognitive skills. Take a game such as Super Mario Bros. It requires you not only to have quick reactions, visual understanding and motoric coordination, but also to plan a path through the level, decide about tradeoffs between various path options (which include different risks and rewards), predict the future position and state of enemies and other characters of the level, predict the physics of your own running and jumping, and balance the demands of limited time to finish the level with multiple goals. Other games introduce demands of handling incomplete information (e.g. StarCraft), understanding narrative (e.g. Skyrim), or very long-term planning (e.g. Civilization).\n\nA very simple car racing game I hacked up for a bunch of experiments that went into my PhD thesis. We also used it for a competition.\n\n\nOn top of this, video games are run inside controllable environments in a computer and many (though not all) video games can be sped up to many times the original speed. It is simple and cheap to get started, and experiments can be run many thousand times in quick succession, allowing the use of learning algorithms.\n\nSo it is not surprising that AI researchers have increasingly turned to video games as benchmarks recently. Researchers such as myself have adapted a number of video games to function as AI benchmarks. In many cases we have organized competitions where researchers can submit their best game-playing AIs and test them against the best that other researchers can produce; having recurring competitions based on the same game allows competitors to refine their approaches and methods, hoping to win next year. Games for which we have run such competitions include Super Mario Bros (paper), StarCraft (paper), the TORCS racing game (paper), Ms Pac-Man (paper), a generic Street Fighter-style figthing game (paper), Angry Birds (paper), Unreal Tournament (paper) and several others. In most of these competitions, we have seen performance of the winning AI player improve every time the competition is run. These competitions play an important role in catalyzing research in the community, and every year many papers are published where the competition software is used for benchmarking some new AI method. Thus, we advance AI through game-based competitions.\n\nThere's a problem with the picture I just painted. Can you spot it?\n\nThat's right. Game specificity. The problem is that improving how well an artificial intelligence plays a particular game is not necessarily helping us improve artificial intelligence in general. It's true that in most of the game-based competitions mentioned above we have seen the submitted AIs get better every time the competition ran. But in most cases, the improvements were not because of better AI algorithms, but because of even more ingenious ways of using these algorithms for the particular problems. Sometimes this meant relegating the AI to a more peripheral role. For example, in the car racing competition the first years were dominated by AIs that used evolutionary algorithms to train a neural network to keep the car on the track. In later years, most of the best submissions used hand-crafted \"dumb\" methods to keep the car on the track, but used learning algorithms to learn the shape of the track to adapt the driving. This is a clever solution to a very specific engineering problem but says very little about intelligence in general.\n\nThe game Ms. Pac-Man was used in a successful recent AI competition, which saw academic researchers, students and enthusiasts from around the world submit their AI Pac-Man players. The challenge of playing Pac-Man spurred researchers to invent new versions of state-of-the-art algorithms to try to get ahead. Unfortunately, the best computer players so far are no better than an intermediate human.\n\nIn order to make sure that what such a competition measures is anything approaching actual intelligence, we need to recast the problem. To do this, it's a great idea to define what it is we want to measure: general intelligence. Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter have proposed a very useful definition of intelligence, which is roughly the average performance of an agent on all possible problems. (In their original formulation, each problem's contribution to the average is weighed by its simplicity, but let's disregard that for now.) Obviously, testing an AI on all possible problems is not an option, as there are infinitely many problems. But maybe we could test our AI on just a sizable number of diverse problems? For example on a number of different video games?\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind here is to just to take a bunch of existing games for some game console, preferably one that could be easily emulated and sped up to many times real time speed, and build an AI benchmark on them. This is what the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) does. ALE lets you test your AI on more than a hundred games released for 70s vintage Atari 2600 console. The AI agents get feeds of the screen at pixel level, and have to respond with a joystick command. ALE has been used in a number of experiments, including those by the original developers of the framework. Perhaps most famously, Google Deep Mind published a paper in Nature showing how they could learn to play several of the games with superhuman skill using deep learning (Q-learning on a deep convolutional network).\n\nThe Atari 2600 video game console. Note the 1977-vintage graphics of the Combat game on the TV in the background. Note, also, the 1977-vintage wooden panel. Your current game console probably suffers from a lack of wooden panels. Not in picture: 128 bytes of memory. That's a few million times less than your cell phone.\n\n\nALE is an excellent AI benchmark, but has a key limitation. The problem with using Atari 2600 games is that there is only a finite number of them, and developing new games is a trick process. The Atari 2600 is notoriously hard to program, and the hardware limitations of the console tightly constrain what sort of games can be implemented. More importantly, all of the existing games are known and available to everyone. This makes it possible to tune your AI to each particular game. Not only to train your AI for each game (DeepMind's results depend on playing each game many thousands of times to train on it) but to tune your whole system to work better on the games you know you will train on.\n\nCan we do better than this? Yes we can! If we want to approximate testing our AI on all possible problems, the best we can do is to test it on a number of unseen problems. That is, the designer of the AI should not know which problems it is being tested on before the test. At least, this was our reasoning when we designed the General Video Game Playing Competition.\n\n\"Frogger\" for the Atari 2600.\n\n\nThe General Video Game Playing Competition (GVGAI) allows anyone to submit their best AI players to a special server, which will then use them to play ten games that no-one (except the competition organizers) have seen before. These games are of the type that you could find on home computers or in arcades in the early eighties; some of them are based on existing games such as Boulder Dash, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Sokoban and Missile Command. The winner of the competition is the AI that plays these unseen games best. Therefore, it is impossible for the creator of the AI to tune their software to any particular game. Around 50 games are available for training your AI on, and every iteration of the competition increases this number as the testing games from the previous iteration become available to train on.\n\n\"Frogger\" implemented in VGDL in the General Video Game Playing framework.\n\n\nNow, 50 games is not such a large number; where do we get new games from? To start with, all the games are programmed in something called the Video Game Description Language (VGDL). This is a simple language we designed to to be able to write games in a compact and human-readable way, a bit like how HTML is used to write web pages. The language is designed explicitly to be able to encode classical arcade games; this means that the games are all based on the movement of and interaction sprites in two dimensions. But that goes for essentially all video games before Wolfenstein 3D. In any case, the simplicity of this language makes it very easy to write new games, either from scratch or as variations on existing games. (Incidentally, as an offshoot of this project we are exploring the use of VGDL as a prototyping tool for game developers.)\n\nA simple version of the classic puzzle game Sokoban implemented in VGDL.\n\n\nEven if it's simple to write new games, that doesn't solve the fundamental problem that someone has to write them, and design them first. For the GVG-AI competition to reach its full potential as a test of general AI, we need an endless supply of new games. For this, we need to generate them. We need software that can produce new games at the press of a button, and these need to be good games that are not only playable but also require genuine skill to win. (As a side effect, such games are likely to be enjoyable for humans.)\n\nBoulder Dash implemented in VGDL in the General Video Game Playing framework.\n\n\nI know, designing software that can design complete new games (that are also good in some sense) sounds quite hard. And it is. However, I and a couple of others have been working on this problem on and off for a couple of years, and I'm firmly convinced it is doable. Cameron Browne has already managed to build a complete generator for playable (and enjoyable) board games, and some of our recent work has focused on generating simple VGDL games, though there is much left to do. Also, it is clearly possible to generate parts of games, such as game levels; there has been plenty of research within the last five years on procedural content generation - the automatic generation of game content. Researchers have demonstrated that methods such as evolutionary algorithms, planning and answer set programming can automatically create levels, maps, stories, items and geometry, and basically any other content type for games. Now, the research challenges are to make these methods general (so that they work for all games, not just for a particular game) and more comprehensive, so that they can generate all aspects of a game including the rules. Most of the generative methods include some form of simulation of the games that are being generated, suggesting that the problems of game playing and game generation are intricately connected and should be considered together whenever possible.\n\nYavalath, a board game designed by computer program designed by Cameron Browne. Proof that computers can design complete games.\n\nOnce we have extended the General Video Game Playing Competition with automated game generation, we have a much better way of testing generic game-playing ability than we have ever had before. The software can of course also be used outside of the competition, providing a way to easily test the general intelligence of game-playing AI.\n\nSo far we have only talked about how to best test or evaluate the general intelligence of a computer program, not how to best create one. Well, this post is about why video games are essential for inventing AI, and I think that I have explained that pretty well: they can be used to fairly and accurately benchmark AIs. But for completeness, let us consider which are the most promising methods for creating AIs of this kind. As mentioned above, (deep) neural networks have recently attracted lots of attention because of some spectacular results in pattern recognition. I believe neural networks and similar pattern recognition methods will have an important role to play for evaluating game states and suggesting actions in various game states. In many cases, evolutionary algorithms are more suitable than gradient-based methods when training neural networks for games.\n\nBut intelligence can not only be pattern recognition. (This is for the same reason that behaviorism is not a complete account of human behavior: people don't just map stimuli to responses\u00a7, sometimes they also think.) Intelligence must also incorporate some aspect of planning, where future sequences of actions can be played out in simulation before deciding what to do. Recently an algorithm called Monte Carlo Tree Search, which simulates the consequences of long sequences of actions by doing statistics of random actions, has worked wonders on the board game Go. It has also done very well on GVGAI. Another family of algorithms that has recently shown great promise on game planning tasks is rolling horizon evolution. Here, evolutionary algorithms are used not for long-term learning, but for short-term action planning.\n\nI think the next wave of advances in general video game-playing AIs will come from ingenious combinations of neural networks, evolution and tree search. And from algorithms inspired by these methods. The important thing is that both pattern recognition and planning will be necessary in various different capacities. As usual in research, we cannot predict what will work well in the future (otherwise it wouldn't be called research), but I bet that exploring various combinations of these method will inspire the invention of the next generation of AI algorithms.\n\nA video game such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim requires a wide variety of cognitive skills to play well.\n\n\nNow, you might object that this is a very limited view of intelligence and AI. What about text recognition, listening comprehension, storytelling, bodily coordination, irony and romance? Our game-playing AIs can't do any of this, no matter if it can play all the arcade games in the world perfectly. To this I say: patience! None of these things are required for playing early arcade games, that is true. But as we master these games and move on to include other genres of games in our benchmark, such as role-playing games, adventure games, simulation games and social network games, many of these skills will be required to play well. As we gradually increase the diversity of games we include in our benchmark, we will also gradually increase the breadth of cognitive skills necessary to play well. Of course, our game-playing AIs will have to get more advanced to cope. Understanding language, images, stories, facial expression and humor will be necessary. And don't forget that closely coupled with the challenge of general video game playing is the challenge of general video game generation, where plenty of other types of intelligence will be necessary. I am convinced that video games (in general) challenges all forms of intelligence except perhaps those closely related to bodily movement, and therefore that video game (in general) is the best testbed for artificial intelligence. An AI that can play almost any video game and create a wide variety of video games is, by any reasonable standard, intelligent.\n\n\"But why, then, are not most AI researchers working on general video game playing and generation?\"\nTo this I say: patience!\n\nA game such as Civilization V requires a different, but just as wide, skillset to play well.\n\n\nThis blog post became pretty long - I had really intended it to be just a fraction of what it is. But there was so much to explain. In case you've read this far, you might very well have forgotten what I said in the beginning by now. So let me recapitulate:\n\nIt is crucial for artificial intelligence research to have good testbeds. Games are excellent AI testbeds because they pose a wide variety of challenges, similarly to robotics, and are highly engaging. But they are also simpler, cheaper and faster, permitting a lot of research that is not practically possible with robotics. Board games have been used in AI research since the field started, but in the last decade more and more researchers have moved to video games because they offer more diverse and relevant challenges. (They are also more fun.) Competitions play a big role in this. But putting too much effort into AI for a single game has limited value for AI in general. Therefore we created the General Video Game Playing Competition and its associated software framework. This is meant to be the most complete game-based benchmark for general intelligence. AIs are evaluated on playing not a single video game, but on multiple games which the AI designer has not seen before. It is likely that the next breakthroughs in general video game playing will come from a combination of neural networks, evolutionary algorithms and Monte Carlo tree search. Coupled with the challenge of playing these games, is the challenge of generating new games and new content for these games. The plan is to have an infinite supply of games to test AIs on. While playing and generating simple arcade games tests a large variety of cognitive capacities - more diverse than any other AI benchmark - we are not yet at the stage where we test all of intelligence. But there is no reason to think we would not get there, given the wide variety of intelligence that is needed to play and design modern video games.\n\nIf you want to know more about these topics, I've linked various blog posts, articles and books from the text above. Most of the research I'm doing (and that we do in the NYU Game Innovation Lab) is in some way connected to the overall project I've been describing here. I recently put together a little overview of research I've done in the past few years, with links to most of my recent papers. Many more papers can be found on my web page. It is also important to realize that most of this work has a dual purpose: to advance artificial intelligence and to make games more fun. Many of the technologies that we are developing are to a lesser or greater extent focused on improving games. It's important to note that there is still important work to be done in advancing AI for particular games. In another recent blog post, I tried to envision what video games would be like if we had actual artificial intelligence. A somewhat recent paper I co-wrote tries to outline the whole field of AI in games, but it's rather long and complex so I would advise you to read the blog post first. You can also peruse the proceedings of the Computational Intelligence and Games and Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment conference series.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that there is plenty of room to get involved in this line of research (I think of it all as an overarching meta-project) as there are many, many open research questions. So if you are not already doing research on this I think you should start working in this field. It's exciting, because it's the future. So what are you waiting for?\n",

Now the other PC OEMs are getting in on the action.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n            \n              \n            \n          \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n      \n    \n    \n                      \n                      \n          \nIt took Microsoft three attempts\u00a0to come up with a Surface concept that had broad appeal. With\u00a0the\u00a0combination of screen size, resolution, system flexibility, and performance, the\u00a0Surface Pro 3\u00a0became a PC that worked for a lot of people. As a tablet, it was thinner and lighter and better to use handheld than any laptop, but its kickstand and magnetic keyboard meant that it offered much of the productivity that laptops boast.\nNow that\u00a0Microsoft has found\u00a0a formula that works and demonstrated\u00a0that it has some user appeal, we've seen a proliferation of similar devices from other manufacturers. The Spectre x2 is HP's consumer-oriented iteration of the concept: a 12-inch tablet with an integrated kickstand, a magnetically attached keyboard, an x86 processor, and a full desktop operating system.\nNailing the basics\n\n\n\nSpecs at a glance: HP Spectre x2\n\n\n\nBase\nBest\nAs reviewed\n\n\nScreen\n1920\u00d71280 12.0\" (192 PPI), 10-point capacitive WLED-backlist IPS touchscreen\n\n\nOS\nWindows 10 Home\n\n\nCPU\nIntel 6th\u00a0generation Core m3\nIntel 6th generation Core m7\nIntel 6th generation Core m7\n\n\nRAM\n4GB\n8GB\n8GB\n\n\nGPU\nIntel HD Graphics 515\n\n\nSSD\n128GB\n512GB\n256GB\n\n\nNetworking\n802.11ac/a/b/g/n with 2x2 MIMO antennas, Bluetooth 4.0\n\n\nPorts\n2 USB Type-C, microSD\n\n\nCameras\nRear: 8MP autofocus, plus 1920\u00d71080 stereoscopic\nFront: 5MP\n\n\nSize\n11.81\u00d78.23\u00d70.31\" (tablet only)\n11.81\u00d78.23\u00d70.52\" (tablet with keyboard)\n\n\nWeight\n1.84lb (tablet only)\n2.68lb (tablet with keyboard)\n\n\nBattery\n42Wh\n\n\nWarranty\n1 year\n\n\nPrice\n$799\n$1,399\n$1,149\n\n\nOther features\n45W charger, TPM 2.0, integrated LTE, keyboard\n\n\n\nFor me, the most important parts of just about any computer are the parts you have to touch and look at; the keyboard, the touchpad, and the screen. These things have to be done right before I ever care about what's on the inside of the system, because if I hate using a computer, I don't really care\u00a0about its speed.\nLike the Surface Pro 4, the Spectre x2 is not great for using on your lap. This is contentious, I know. Some people, presumably with much longer legs than my own, think it's fine. For me, the kickstand design doesn't provide enough stability and rigidity to support comfortable on-lap usage. This is a desk/table-bound design, not a full laptop replacement.\nBut when used on a desk or table, the Spectre x2 is very good. The backlit metal keyboard feels very sturdy, the key travel is excellent (1.5mm, according to HP), and the layout is pretty sensible. This is a good keyboard. Like the Surface Pro 3 and 4, the keyboard has a magnetic strip that gives it a slight angle for more comfortable typing.\n\n          \n                      \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \nThis is a keyboard that anyone would be happy with, one that puts many laptops, much less tablets, to shame.\nThe touchpad is also pretty decent. Its shape is a little unusual; as we've seen on some other HP machines, it's very wide without being tremendously tall. I found it tracked accurately and had a nice smooth surface. It supports the Precision Touchpad spec, too, so it provides the full range of Windows 10 touchpad gestures.\nThe screen is a decently bright and crisp 1920\u00d71280 3:2 WLED-backlit affair. There are higher resolutions available from competing systems, but I didn't feel that I was missing out on much here. Viewing angles are good, the backlight seems even, and the brightness was sufficient for most viewing conditions.\nBut it is\u00a0a touchscreen, and everything worked in that regard. More unusually, it has Wacom pen support. HP sells (though does not supply in the box) a pen for use with the Spectre x2 that supports 2048 pressure levels. The pen is an active design, using a AAAA battery that HP says will last for about 700 hours. I can't speak to the finer points of this feature based on my mediocre attempts at doodling, but tracking seemed accurate, with little discernible gap between the pen point and cursor and good precision even at low speeds. Palm rejection was also reliable.\n\n    \n              \n                \n              \n                This is a really good keyboard.\n                              \n            \n                  \n          \n    \n    \n      This is a really good keyboard.\n\n          \n  \n        \n            \n\nAll in all, the Spectre x2 gets these essential elements right. I don't want\u00a0to tempt fate, but I suspect that this is becoming a trend across the industry. While I'm sure that things are less good at the very bottom of the market, I think it's now safe to say that there are good input and output devices across a wide range of the portable PC market. This wasn't the case even two or three years ago, but today, whatever\u00a0form factor you choose, whether it be the traditional laptop, the 360 degree hinge laptop (the Lenovo Yoga and its competitors), the hinged convertible (such as the Surface Book), or the magnetic detachable (such as the Surface Pro 4 or the Spectre x2), you can find multiple competing options with keyboards, touchpads, and screens that aren't just tolerable\u2014they're actually good. On the one hand it's disappointing that this is a notable landmark for the PC industry, but on the other, it's pleasing that a corner of some kind has been turned.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \n\n    \n              \n                \n              \n                HP Spectre x2.\n                              \n            \n                  \n          \n    \n    \n      HP Spectre x2.\n\n          \n  \n        \n            \n\nI think that the Spectre x2 also looks pretty good. The buttons feel high-quality, the detailing around the speaker grilles looks nice, and the soft covering of the keyboard is pleasing to the touch. Again, this isn't something that I felt was necessarily the case four or five years ago; shoddily built, flimsy systems that flexed and wobbled as you used them were commonplace, even on machines commanding premium prices. There's none of that with the Spectre.\nCore M continues to confuse\nWith these basics more than satisfactory, it's time to talk about everything else. Unlike Microsoft, which only uses the Core m3 in the cheapest Surface Pro 4, HP has committed across the full Spectre x2 range to using Intel's Core M Skylake processors with 4 or 8GB of RAM.\nThe first Core M processors, from the Broadwell processor generation, didn't impress us. They gave up a lot of performance, performed inconsistently from system to system, and didn't seem to win much in the way of battery life in return.\u00a0The Skylake Core M parts have had wider adoption, finding their way into a much larger\u00a0range of systems. It's also become clearer how and why manufacturers are using them.\nThe Skylake Core M parts seem to be better balanced than their predecessors. In extended workloads, their low power rating limits their performance; the processor can sustain a speed of around 1.2GHz (depending on the exact model). But for short bursts, such as the initial hit you take from loading a new webpage or starting a new app, the processor can ramp up to 3.1GHz, making it every bit as quick as any other Skylake processor.\nBut if you think this low-power processor is going to mean better battery life, well, that's a little more complicated. We ran two battery life tests. One cycles through webpages every fifteen seconds, intended to be representative of a browsing session where you load a page and then read it for a while before moving on. The other is a heavier burden; it runs a WebGL animation continuously.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \n\n\nThese tests have different performance profiles. The first has a burst of activity every fifteen seconds but allows the processor to idle in the gaps. The second keeps both processor and GPU continuously operating. In the first test, the x2's performance wasn't too impressive. Both the x2 and the Surface Pro 4 have 42Wh batteries, but the Surface Pro 4 (with a Core i5) could manage 491 minutes in this test. The x2 with its Core m7 only hit 430 minutes. The lower power processor lost. But perhaps that's not terribly surprising: in this benchmark, both processors idle most of the time, and they both idle at closer to zero watts.\nIn the second test, however, the situation was different. The x2 managed 260 minutes, compared to Surface Pro 4's 217. In this sustained workload, the Surface Pro 4's processor can run at a sustained higher speed, drawing more power. The x2, in contrast, slashes its clock speed to keep inside its low power envelope. This means that the x2\u00a0doesn't go as fast and animate as smoothly as the Surface, but it extends its battery life.\nAccordingly, it's not really appropriate to think of Core M as the low power, long life option. Rather, the low power rating means it makes a different trade-off under sustained workloads. It's slower, but it lasts longer.\nThe low power processor isn't any cheaper, either, than the higher-powered parts. The Core m7-6Y75 in our review Spectre costs $393 from Intel. The Core i7-6600U in the high-end Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book is also $393.\nIt doesn't appear to translate into a lighter laptop, either. The Spectre x2 is surprisingly heavy. OK, it's still not heavy heavy, but at 1.84lbs for the tablet unit alone, it weighs more than any of Microsoft's latest generation of tablets.\nSo what's the point of the Core M part? Simple: it obviates the need for a fan. The Spectre x2 is fanless, ensuring silent operation with no moving parts. That feature\u00a0should let systems be a little slimmer, lighter, and more reliable.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \nOverall, the Spectre x2 feels\u00a0perfectly snappy and pleasant to use. I wouldn't get one for gaming or software development or running a ton of virtual machines because I don't think the Core M is really up to it. But for general Office-type tasks, Web browsing, and e-mail, the device is a\u00a0decent option.\n\nRefined ideas\n\n    \n              \n                \n              \n                This is a neat kickstand.\n                              \n            \n                  \n          \n    \n    \n      This is a neat kickstand.\n\n          \n  \n        \n            \n\nWhile the Surface Pro 3 arguably defined this category, HP's machine is no mere copycat. The Spectre x2's kickstand in particular is a smart improvement on Microsoft's concept. Rather than a solid sheet of metal, the x2 uses a U-shaped metal hoop that folds out from the back and holds the screen in just about any position from laid flat to upright. The use of a hoop rather than a flat piece means that the x2 can be thinner. The Surface family of devices essentially have a double thickness of metal on the back: the back panel itself and then the kickstand covering it. The x2 doesn't need this.\nIts kickstand doesn't appear to give anything up in terms of rigidity or effectiveness. The hinge is satisfyingly stiff and it holds the screen securely at a wide range of angles.The stiffness reinforces the machine's overall feeling of quality. As with Microsoft's design, I do find myself wondering how good it's going to feel one, two, or three years down the line, but right now it is very pleasing.\nThis is a sleek design and I almost like it a lot; it represents a meaningful, if incremental, improvement on Microsoft's design. Almost, because HP has made the kickstand latched. When it's closed, you can only open it by sliding a little button on the side of the machine. This makes the kickstand more awkward to use; you can't just grab it and open it, you have to make the detour via the button first. I think HP has probably realized that this is slightly awkward, as the Elite x2, a design\u00a0similar to the Spectre x2 but aimed at the business market, ditches the button.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \nThe removal of the fan and the smarter kickstand should mean that the Spectre is slimmer than Microsoft's hardware. It is,\u00a0but not by much: 0.31 inches thick compared to 0.33. While the Surface Pro 4 manages to fit a full-size USB Type-A port, the Spectre x2 has Type-C ports, one on each side, either of which can be used for charging. It ships in the box with a Type-C to Type-A converter.\nBuilt for the future, not the present\n\nI had mixed feelings about the use of Type-A on the Surface Pro 4, and I have similarly mixed feelings about the use of Type-C in the Spectre x2. Type-C is the future\u2014there's no doubt about that. The small size is convenient (though the thicker, more expensive, frequently out-of-spec cables are currently an annoyance), the lack of directionality makes it easier to use, and the port itself is much more flexible.\nThe problem is that right now, Type-C still isn't tremendously useful. Virtually every USB device that you attach to the machine will have to use that dongle. For example, in my line of work I regularly receive\u00a0USB memory sticks containing press releases, photographs, and similar information about products being launched. These sticks are invariably cheap, disposable things with capacities somewhere between 2 and\u00a04GB, and I think it's going to be a long time before they are consistently replaced with Type-C parts, especially as most people still don't have many or any Type-C ports. All this makes Type-C something of an annoyance; it's one more piece of equipment to remember to throw into my laptop bag, one more thing to lose, one more cable to stop working at the worst possible moment.\nAs such, I wish HP had split the difference and offered at least one traditional Type-A port instead of the dongle. The company told me that the device's thickness forced the use of Type-C, but since the\u00a0Surface Pro 4 was\u00a0only a hair thicker\u2014and since the Elite x2 managed\u00a0to include a Type-A port despite\u00a0being one hundredth of an inch thinner\u2014I'm not convinced by this.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \nI don't really envy the hardware companies. This USB transition is going to be awkward for a few years. Type-A USB along with HDMI and/or DisplayPort ports are all better in the short term, while Type-C USB with support for charging, DisplayPort alternate mode, and even Thunderbolt 3 are all better in the long term. For now, I think that the best bet is to offer a mix of old and new unless physical constraints truly preclude offering the old ports.\nIn the Spectre x2, I don't believe that's the case. A Type-A port could have been included. Still, at least HP includes the conversion cable, which not every manufacturer does.\nNo Hello here\nAnother decision that I'm feeling decidedly mixed on is the cameras. They are serviceable given my low expectations of tablet cameras in general, but I just don't feel comfortable using them to frame and take photos. HP has chosen to equip the Spectre x2 with Intel's RealSense 3D camera. Intel has two variants of this camera: one designed for short viewing distances for use in front-facing cameras for biometric facial recognition authentication and one designed for long viewing distances for use in rear-facing cameras for 3D photography and similar.\nHP has gone for the latter variant. As such, while the Spectre x2 can be used for taking 3D pictures, or to do \"trick shot\" type stuff where a photo's focus is adjusted in post production, it can't be used for Windows Hello-style authentication.\n\n    \n              \n                \n              \n                The RealSense 3D camera.\n                              \n            \n                  \n          \n    \n    \n      The RealSense 3D camera.\n\n          \n  \n        \n            \n\nOn the one hand, I know that 3D photography has interesting applications, especially as 3D modeling and printing are becoming popular activities. I don't for a moment doubt that some people will do fun and exciting things with this camera, especially as more applications using the RealSense SDK become available. This is a field that HP is actively engaging in, too; its Sprout PC is finding all sorts of applications both within education and industry that leverage its combination of 3D vision and projection.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n          \n          \nBut\u00a0Windows Hello is fabulous\u00a0and will prove its worth every time you sit down at your computer to unlock it. If forced to pick one or the other, I'd go for Hello and the front-facing camera every time.\nFrustratingly, the otherwise great keyboard doesn't include any kind of a fingerprint scanner option, either. HP does have such a thing for the Elite x2, again because of its more corporate positioning, but I truly think that Hello-capable hardware, whether facial or fingerprint, is highly desirable for home and professional users alike.\nHP includes an integrated LTE modem. This worked effortlessly with the Verizon SIM that HP included in my review system. With Microsoft's new easy-access no-contract cellular data scheme I wonder if this sort of thing might start to become more common. It's not something I'd need every day, but when I need it\u2014in a hotel with crap Wi-Fi, for example\u2014it can be a lifesaver.\nIf I have any serious complaint about the Spectre x2, it's not with the hardware but rather with the software. It includes a bundled version of some McAfee security tool (\"LiveSafe\")\u00a0that was\u00a0unpleasantly intrusive, popping up alerts even during normal operations. I strongly believe that systems are better off using the built-in Windows security features and nothing more, because the Windows features are much less likely to annoyingly and spuriously interfere with normal operations.\nWhenever I use a review system, I try to stick to a usage pattern and software loadout as close to default as I can, to better get a feel for what the machine will be like for regular buyers, but I had to remove this McAfee stuff.\nSurface Pro quality and capability for 20 percent off\nThe HP Spectre x2 is not the lightest machine in its class, nor the fastest machine in its class, nor the longest lasting machine in its class. But it is well-built, and it includes\u00a0a\u00a0great keyboard. It looks smart, too.\n\n          \n                  \n                    \n        \n          \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n          \n          \nAnd then there's the small matter of the price. The Spectre x2 starts at $799. That gets you a Core m3, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, the LTE modem, and, critically, the keyboard. A Surface Pro 4 for $899 has more screen resolution, the same processor, RAM, and storage, no LTE, and\u00a0no keyboard. Adding the keyboard takes you to $1,029.\nThe\u00a0Surface Pro 4 does include a pen, whereas for HP it's a $50 extra (if you want it). But from where I'm sitting, that looks like about a $230 price difference for machines that are otherwise very comparable.\nAt the top end, the situation for the Spectre x2 is perhaps a little less compelling, or at least a little less clear. $1,399 gets you a Core m7, 8GB RAM, and a 512GB disk, along with LTE and the keyboard. While this is cheaper than a Surface Pro 4 with a Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB disk, no LTE, and no keyboard\u2014that costs $1,699\u2014the performance differential between the systems may be substantial, depending on your workload, making a like-for-like comparison harder to do. For some, the x2 may still be a bargain; for others, it would simply be paying less to get a less capable machine.\nPut together, we have a machine with all the quality and flexibility of a Surface Pro 4, but quite a bit cheaper. If you really need the performance of the full strength processors (and the fan that comes along with the ride) you'll have to look elsewhere, but if you don't, the Spectre x2 will serve you very well indeed.\nThe Good\n\nGreat keyboard\nKeen price\nElegant kickstand\nSolid build\nTwin USB Type-C ports\n\nThe Bad\n\nCore M may allow ditching the fan, but it's not winning us much battery life in return\nIt's a little heavier than its more expensive competition\nIts battery life is a little worse than its more expensive competition\nNo Windows Hello support\nA USB Type-A port in addition to the Type-C would have been nice\n\nThe Ugly\n\nMaking the user experience worse by bundling extra software continues to be the PC industry's worst habit\n\n\n\n          \n                  \n\n                  \n          \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    97 Comments\n  \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n              \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n              \n                      \n              \n            \n                    \n        \n                    \n                    \n        \n                    \n                    \n        \n                    \n                    \n        \n                    \n                    \n        \n                  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  ",

    "original_score": 4,

    "scraped_body": "\n    When more than 100,000 people in and around the Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk were left without power for six hours, the Ukrainian energy ministry accused Russia of launching a cyberattack on the country\u2019s national energy grid. \n\nNow reports released by security researchers from the SANS Industrial Control Systems team and the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team confirm their belief that a cyberattack was responsible for the power cut, making the incident one of the first significant, publicly reported cyberattacks on civil infrastructure.\n\nThis is a rare event, of which the most famous example is the Stuxnet malware used to destroy equipment in the Iranian nuclear programme. Many consider Stuxnet so sophisticated that national governments must have been involved. But as is frequently the case, attributing responsibility for Stuxnet has proved difficult, and it\u2019s likely that, despite circumstantial evidence, it will be the same in this case. While the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) and the international press were quick to blame Russian state-backed hackers, Moscow has remained silent.\n\n\n            \n            \n              When control systems turn bad.\n              David Becher, CC BY-SA\n            \n          \n\nExperts examining the attack in Ukraine found that BlackEnergy malware appeared to have been used to gain entry to the national grid\u2019s systems. Certainly BlackEnergy has in the past been used for launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, cybercrime, information theft, global infection of industrial control systems and targeted attacks against Ukraine and Poland. BlackEnergy is seen as the calling card of the Sandworm hacking group, which has been linked to the Russian state.\n\nWhile the researchers found no evidence that BlackEnergy was directly used to bring down the power supply, forensic analysis has revealed a multi-pronged attack. After the power was cut, denial of service attacks were deployed to try to prevent error messages from reaching service personnel, while the malware wiped the control systems\u2019 servers in order to delay repair and cover its tracks. This attention to detail suggests the attack was indeed aimed deliberately at these particular electricity facilities. \n\nThe spread of technical sophistication\n\nOne consequence of this incident is that many more governments have become acutely aware of the potential vulnerabilities of national civilian infrastructure such as electricity, gas, water and transport networks. Questions regarding the vulnerability of the national grid are being asked in the US, for example. \n\nInevitably, such attacks also cause tensions between nations. But it\u2019s worth noting that a tense international situation does not necessarily imply that one party is responsible for an attack on another. The increasing availability of sophisticated malware that can be found online has lowered the bar to launching a sophisticated attack \u2013 though a successful attack is still regarded as very difficult \u2013 meaning that there many potential culprits. A rush to judgement is inadvisable: the Russians were blamed for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline explosion in 2008, for example, since the Russo-Georgian war began two days later. This conclusion has since been challenged. \n\n\n            \n            \n              Vulnerable industrial control systems that run, build and monitor things are all around us.\n              BMW Werk Leipzig, CC BY-SA\n            \n          \n\nOld equipment faces new problems\n\nIndustrial control systems \u2013 those used in all manner of infrastructure in healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, and transport \u2013 are moving from high-cost, proprietary hardware and software provided by a handful of specialist companies towards cheaper, more flexible off-the-shelf systems. This increases the scope for attack as the systems are more easily available to practice on. \n\nProject SHINE used the SHODAN search engine to discover what level of risk is posed by internet-connected industrial control devices. In January 2014 the project wound up due to the rate at which new devices were appearing \u2013 more than a million at the final count.\n\nThe problem is that the industrial control systems now being connected to the internet were designed in the pre-internet era. The underlying protocols and components take no account of modern internet threats and so are inherently insecure. These vulnerabilities have led to economic damage and lost production, environmental damage, injury and loss of life, and scale up to potentially catastrophic nationwide effects, as in Ukraine.\n\nWhile there have been relatively few attacks so far, as more off-the-shelf consumer-grade hardware and software finds its way into critical infrastructure a growing number of highly-skilled \u201cblack hat\u201d hackers, motivated by malice, greed or politics, will find ways to exploit these vulnerabilities. With their rudimentary defences, many industrial control systems are no match. Unfortunately staff within many organisations are ill-prepared to prevent, identify or respond; the growing attentions of attackers, together with this lack of knowledge and some complacency is recipe for enormous harm. \n\nTo cloud the picture still further is the rapid progress towards an Internet of Things, where physical objects of all types are connected to, and controlled over, the internet. This will underpin the next generation of industrial systems, but will also be common throughout government, business and the home. If we do not learn the lessons of Ukraine and think deeply about the potential threats, there is a very real prospect of major economic and social damage. We must look hard at what is coming and prepare for the worst.\n  ",

We get to tackle large impact marketing challenges while also getting to enjoy small town living. An important part of small town life is access to a thriving and unique Main Street. Keene\u2019s downtown is made up of a wide variety of local, independent businesses.According to a recent study, businesses that are online grow 40% faster than those that aren\u2019t (source: BCG Report, The Connected World). In an effort to give back to the town we love, Paragon teamed up with the New England Web & Tech Collective, The Center of Entrepreneurship at Hannah Grimes, and Google, to help get all of Keene\u2019s Main Street businesses up-to-date online.These updated Google Business Listings make it easier for potential customers to find a business online, verify its contact information, and read reviews from other patrons. It\u2019s a free and simple way to grow a business. In fact, businesses with complete Google Business Listings are 2x as likely to be considered reputable (source: Google/Oxera, The Benefits of Complete Business Listings, December 2014).Along with helping to get all their information up-to-date, we also took 360-degree interior photography of each business. This interior photography allows people searching for a business online to take a virtual tour from their computer or mobile device (similar to Google Street View). The results are pretty remarkable!Ted McGreer, owner of Ted\u2019s Shoe & Sport, had this to say about the project: \u201cIn this day and age of online retail and big box stores, it can be hard to compete. Having a digital presence on Google helps us compete. We\u2019re really excited about it.\u201dHow to Get InvolvedParagon is working with the New England Web & Tech Collective (NEWT) to find ways to continue and expand this project. If you\u2019re interested in helping to put Keene on the map, let us know by contacting NEWT.Head on over to the Google Get Your Business on the Map page and see if your Business Listing is complete.Search for your favorite Keene business on Google and write an honest, helpful review.Check out some of the 360-degree interiors views on the NEWT project page and let us know what you think in the comments.",

    "scraped_body": "The White House is once again making the full text of the State of the Union available online ahead of the speech, as prepared for delivery, continuing efforts to meet people where they are and make the speech as accessible as possible. On Medium, people can follow along with the speech as they watch in real time at WhiteHouse.gov/SOTU, view charts and infographics on key areas, share their favorite lines, and provide feedback.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:Tonight marks the eighth year I\u2019ve come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I\u2019m going to try to make it shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.I also understand that because it\u2019s an election season, expectations for what we\u2019ll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again.But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I\u2019ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.But for my final address to this chamber, I don\u2019t want to talk just about the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.I want to focus on our future.We live in a time of extraordinary change \u2014 change that\u2019s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world. It\u2019s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It\u2019s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.America has been through big changes before \u2014 wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \u201cdogmas of the quiet past.\u201d Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America\u2019s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people. And because we did \u2014 because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril \u2014 we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation \u2014 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law \u2014 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it\u2019s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It\u2019s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It\u2019s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?So let\u2019s talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer \u2014 regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us \u2014 especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\u2019s best in us, and not what\u2019s worst?Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We\u2019re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the \u201990s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we\u2019ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.Anyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. What is true \u2014 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2014 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven\u2019t let up. Today, technology doesn\u2019t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It\u2019s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody. We\u2019ve made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments we\u2019ve had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we\u2019ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We\u2019ve already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower\u2019s income. Now, we\u2019ve actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I\u2019m going to keep fighting to get that started this year.Of course, a great education isn\u2019t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn\u2019t lose what they\u2019ve already worked so hard to build.That\u2019s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn\u2019t weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\u2019s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we\u2019ll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.Now, I\u2019m guessing we won\u2019t agree on health care anytime soon. But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that\u2019s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn\u2019t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\u2019s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That\u2019s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I\u2019d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.But there are other areas where it\u2019s been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years \u2014 namely what role the government should play in making sure the system\u2019s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there\u2019s red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won\u2019t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn\u2019t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren\u2019t the reason wages haven\u2019t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It\u2019s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who\u2019ve figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\u2019t deny Sputnik was up there. We didn\u2019t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.That spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We\u2019re Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We\u2019re Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We\u2019re every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world. And over the past seven years, we\u2019ve nurtured that spirit.We\u2019ve protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We\u2019ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they\u2019ve had in over a decade. Tonight, I\u2019m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\u2019s gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I\u2019m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we\u2019ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You\u2019ll be pretty lonely, because you\u2019ll be debating our military, most of America\u2019s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\u2019s a problem and intend to solve it.But even if the planet wasn\u2019t at stake; even if 2014 wasn\u2019t the warmest year on record \u2014 until 2015 turned out even hotter \u2014 why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal \u2014 in jobs that pay better than average. We\u2019re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2014 something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.Gas under two bucks a gallon ain\u2019t bad, either.Now we\u2019ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future \u2014 especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we\u2019ll create, the money we\u2019ll save, and the planet we\u2019ll preserve \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that\u2019s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there\u2019s a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America\u2019s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It\u2019s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead \u2014 they call us.As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that\u2019s not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria \u2014 states they see slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.It\u2019s up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set priorities.Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today\u2019s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That\u2019s the story ISIL wants to tell; that\u2019s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don\u2019t need to build them up to show that we\u2019re serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world\u2019s largest religions. We just need to call them what they are \u2014 killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.That\u2019s exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\u2019s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can\u2019t stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2014 in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t pass muster on the world stage.We also can\u2019t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That\u2019s not leadership; that\u2019s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It\u2019s the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq \u2014 and we should have learned it by now.Fortunately, there\u2019s a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.That\u2019s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\u2019re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.That\u2019s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.That\u2019s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.That\u2019s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs. With TPP, China doesn\u2019t set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That\u2019s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world \u2014 except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change \u2014 that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria \u2014 something I\u2019ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.That\u2019s strength. That\u2019s leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.That\u2019s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn\u2019t a matter of political correctness. It\u2019s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that \u201cto imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\u201d When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn\u2019t make us safer. That\u2019s not telling it like it is. It\u2019s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.\u201cWe the People.\u201dOur Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we\u2019ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.The future we want \u2014 opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2014 all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn\u2019t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. That\u2019s one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn\u2019t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\u2019t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.Too many Americans feel that way right now. It\u2019s one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2014 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. There\u2019s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I\u2019ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task \u2014 or any President\u2019s \u2014 alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; you\u2019ve told me. And if we want a better politics, it\u2019s not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can\u2019t bankroll our elections \u2014 and if our existing approach to campaign finance can\u2019t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. We\u2019ve got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.But I can\u2019t do these things on my own. Changes in our political process \u2014 in not just who gets elected but how they get elected \u2014 that will only happen when the American people demand it. It will depend on you. That\u2019s what\u2019s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.What I\u2019m asking for is hard. It\u2019s easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn\u2019t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don\u2019t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\u2019t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.We can\u2019t afford to go down that path. It won\u2019t deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.It won\u2019t be easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I\u2019ll be right there with you as a citizen \u2014 inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word \u2014 voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.They\u2019re out there, those voices. They don\u2019t get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you. I know you\u2019re there. You\u2019re the reason why I have such incredible confidence in our future. Because I see your quiet, sturdy citizenship all the time.I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.I see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over \u2014 and the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him \u2019til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.It\u2019s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he\u2019s been taught.I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.That\u2019s the America I know. That\u2019s the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That\u2019s what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That\u2019s why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",

    "scraped_body": "Computer vision is now a part of everyday life. Facebook recognizes faces in the photos you post to the popular social network. The Google Photos app can find images buried in your collection, identifying everything from dogs to birthday parties to gravestones. Twitter can pinpoint pornographic images without help from human curators.All of this \"seeing\" stems from a remarkably effective breed of artificial intelligence called deep learning. But as far as this much-hyped technology has come in recent years, a new experiment from Microsoft Research shows it's only getting started. Deep learning can go so much deeper.This revolution in computer vision was a long time coming. A key turning point came in 2012, when artificial intelligence researchers from the University of Toronto won a competition called ImageNet. ImageNet pits machines against each other in an image recognition contest---which computer can identify cats or cars or clouds more accurately?---and that year, the Toronto team, including researcher Alex Krizhevsky and professor Geoff Hinton, topped the contest using deep neural nets, a technology that learns to identify images by examining enormous numbers of them, rather than identifying images according to rules diligently hand-coded by humans.Toronto's win provided a roadmap for the future of deep learning. In the years since, the biggest names on the 'net---including Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft---have used similar tech to build computer vision systems that can match and even surpass humans. \"We can't claim that our system 'sees' like a person does,\" says Peter Lee, the head of research at Microsoft. \"But what we can say is that for very specific, narrowly defined tasks, we can learn to be as good as humans.\"Roughly speaking, neural nets use hardware and software to approximate the web of neurons in the human brain. This idea dates to the 1980s, but in 2012, Krizhevsky and Hinton advanced the technology by running their neural nets atop graphics processing units, or GPUs. These specialized chips were originally designed to render images for games and other highly graphical software, but as it turns out, they're also suited to the kind of math that drives neural nets. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and so many others now use GPU-powered-AI to handle image recognition and so many others tasks, from Internet search to security. Krizhevsky and Hinton joined the staff at Google.Now, the latest ImageNet winner is pointing to what could be another step in the evolution of computer vision---and the wider field of artificial intelligence. Last month, a team of Microsoft researchers took the ImageNet crown using a new approach they call a deep residual network. The name doesn't quite describe it. They've designed a neural net that's significantly more complex than typical designs---one that spans 152 layers of mathematical operations, compared to the typical six or seven. It shows that, in the years to come, companies like Microsoft will be able to use vast clusters of GPUs and other specialized chips to significantly improve not only image recognition but other AI services, including systems that recognize speech and even understand language as we humans naturally speak it.In other words, deep learning is nowhere close to reaching its potential. \"We're staring at a huge design space,\" Lee says, \"trying to figure out where to go next.\"Layers of NeuronsDeep neural networks are arranged in layers. Each layer is a different set of mathematical operations---aka algorithms. The output of one layer becomes the input of the next. Loosely speaking, if a neural network is designed for image recognition, one layer will look for a particular set of features in an image---edges or angles or shapes or textures or the like---and the next will look for another set. These layers are what make these neural networks deep. \"Generally speaking, if you make these networks deeper, it becomes easier for them to learn,\" says Alex Berg, a researcher at the University of North Carolina who helps oversee the ImageNet competition.Today, a typical neural network includes six or seven layers. Some might extend to 20 or even 30. But the Microsoft team, led by researcher Jian Sun, just expanded that to 152. In essence, this neural net is better at recognizing images because it can examine more features. \"There is a lot more subtlety that can be learned,\" Lee says.In the past, according Lee and researchers outside of Microsoft, this sort of very deep neural net wasn't feasible. Part of the problem was that as your mathematical signal moved from layer to layer, it became diluted and tended to fade. As Lee explains, Microsoft solved this problem by building a neural net that skips certain layers when it doesn't need them, but uses them when it does. \"When you do this kind of skipping, you're able to preserve the strength of the signal much further,\" Lee says, \"and this is turning out to have a tremendous, beneficial impact on accuracy.\"Berg says that this is an notable departure from previous systems, and he believes that others companies and researchers will follow suit.Deep DifficultyThe other issue is that constructing this kind of mega-neural net is tremendously difficult. Landing on a particular set of algorithms---determining how each layer should operate and how it should talk to the next layer---is an almost epic task. But Microsoft has a trick here, too. It has designed a computing system that can help build these networks.As Jian Sun explains it, researchers can identify a promising arrangement for massive neural networks, and then the system can cycle through a range of similar possibilities until it settles on this best one. \"In most cases, after a number of tries, the researchers learn [something], reflect, and make a new decision on the next try,\" he says. \"You can view this as 'human-assisted search.'\"According to Adam Gibson---the chief researcher at deep learning startup Skymind---this kind of thing is getting more common. It's called \"hyper parameter optimization.\" \"People can just spin up a cluster [of machines], run 10 models at once, find out which one works best and use that,\" Gibson says. \"They can input some baseline parameter---based on intuition---and the machines kind of homes in on what the best solution is.\" As Gibson notes, last year Twitter acquired a company, Whetlab, that offers similar ways of \"optimizing\" neural networks.'A Hardware Problem'As Peter Lee and Jian Sun describe it, such an approach isn't exactly \"brute forcing\" the problem. \"With very very large amounts of compute resources, one could fantasize about a gigantic 'natural selection' setup where evolutionary forces help direct a brute-force search through a huge space of possibilities,\" Lee says. \"The world doesn't have those computing resources available for such a thing...For now, we will still depend on really smart researchers like Jian.\"But Lee does say that, thanks to new techniques and computer data centers filled with GPU machines, the realm of possibilities for deep learning are enormous. A big part of the company's task is just finding the time and the computing power needed to explore these possibilities. \"This work has dramatically exploded the design space. The amount of ground to cover, in terms of scientific investigation, has become exponentially larger,\" Lee says. And this extends well beyond image recognition, into speech recognition, natural language understanding, and other tasks.As Lee explains, that's one reason Microsoft is not only pushing to improve the power of its GPUs clusters, but exploring the use of other specialized processors, including FPGAs---chips that can programmed for particular tasks, such as deep learning. \"There has also been an explosion in demand for much more experimental hardware platforms from our researchers,\" he says. And this work is sending ripples across the wider of world of tech and artificial intelligence. This past summer, in its largest ever acquisition deal, Intel agreed to buy Altera, which specializes in FPGAs.Indeed, Gibson says that deep learning has become more of \"a hardware problem.\" Yes, we still need top researchers to guide the creation of neural networks, but more and more, finding new paths is a matter of brute-forcing new algorithms across ever more powerful collections of hardware. As Gibson point out, though these deep neural nets work extremely well, we don't quite know why they work. The trick lies in finding the complex combination of algorithms that work the best. More and better hardware can shorten the path.The end result is that the companies that can build the most powerful networks of hardware are the companies that will come out ahead. That would be Google and Facebook and Microsoft. Those that are good at deep learning today will only get better.",

Keep in mind Facebook is reportedly keeping WhatsApp and Instagram independent. This stop the world plan must mean something, unfortunately I don't have the strategic insight to understand why this might be. Any thoughts?The article has more tantalizing details about what's going on with the move:MEANWHILE, THE MIGRATION of Zappos's entire IT infrastructure to Amazon\u2014which means figuring out a way to move an extraordinarily complex set of custom software programs that power a billion-dollar-a-year e-commerce site over to an entirely new environment\u2014continues. The difficulty of this effort is almost unfathomable. Imagine taking a million square pegs and attempting to insert them into a million round holes, except you don't even know if all the holes exist, or where the holes might be located, and you have to negotiate access to the holes with dozens of different teams of hostile software engineers. The project has consumed Zappos's tech department for more than two years, and during that time, the Zappos site has been almost completely static. That means no improvements or innovations and only minimal bug fixes.Barry Van Beek, the project's program manager, told me he thought Supercloud was the single largest e-commerce replatforming in history. \u201cNo one has ever attempted this before, on this scale.\u201d Van Beek, who has been at Zappos for eight years, said Supercloud has about 20 different teams, with 250 to 350 people, including contractors, working with more than 100 different Amazon teams. When they began, they had no idea what they were getting into. It took months to figure out what was available on the Amazon side, and for well over a year, Van Beek wasn't even sure the migration was technically possible. But, he said, Supercloud is an Amazon-mandated goal, and they didn't have any choice. So they figured it out. \u201cThe level of effort,\u201d he said, \u201cwas almost incomprehensible.\u201dVan Beek told me he is confident Supercloud can be completed, but he worries the disruptions caused by the offer, as well as unforeseeable delays on the Amazon side, will slow their progress. When Zappos does complete the migration, he hopes the tech department will be able to turn its attention to innovating in the e-commerce space, tackling challenges such as the size and fit problem. If customers are more likely to arrive at a good fit before they order, eliminating returns and the associated restocking and shipping costs will improve margins.\n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n",

This led to the inception of 4G LTE, which is 10x faster than its predecessor 3G.\nToday, you don\u2019t give a second thought when you have to download a big fat file or have to watch a video on your smartphone. All thanks to 4G LTE, your smartphone does everything that your wired devices can do. As a result, numbers of 4G LTE users are increasing with every passing day.\nWe conducted a research to find out the most innovative and active companies in the field. As the quality of patents filed is a great indicator of innovation quotient of a company, we studied patents filed in the domain of LTE along with few patent specific parameters to arrive at a list of the most innovative companies of LTE.\nPatent Classification of the 4G LTE Technology\nWe formulated a\u00a0group of search logic and executed that on available patent databases to extract the relevant patents filed between 2011 and 2015. We restricted the patent set to recent filing dates as latest patent activities of a company represents areas where it channelizing its research and development efforts. This helps provide accurate results.\nPatents pertinent to the LTE-based communication can be broadly classified into the following categories:-\n\nAfter classifying the extracted patents, we calculated an\u00a0individual patent quality score and further used that to innovation score of a company. The points we considered to calculate these scores are as follows:\nPatent Quality Score: We can judge innovation quotient of a company from the number and quality of patents it owns. That said, we calculated the\u00a0objective score of each patent by including various factors such as bibliographic details of the SEPs (standard essential patents), citations data, family members, grant time, etc.\nA high patent score is indicative of a better quality. Thus, a company with a large number of high scoring patents is considered more innovative than the one with a small number of quality patents.\nCompany Innovation Score: Score of a company is evaluated by taking various factors such as the number of patents owned, average patent score, and the\u00a0number of IPC subclasses being disclosed in the patent portfolio of the company.\nThe Algorithm That We Compiled\nFor determining the top innovators among hundreds or thousands of companies we had to first decide the strength of the patents in each company\u2019s portfolio. With this objective in mind, after a substantial research over the parameters/factors responsible for the innovative strength of a company, we compiled an algorithm. The algorithm uses parameter listed below to obtain a rank of a patent which further helps in assigning a rank for a company.\n\nBased on the algorithm, we identified\u00a0the top 50 global innovators in LTE technology.\nClick on the image to enlarge\nSometimes there is a curiosity to know if all the innovations get developed in-house or get acquired by purchasing patent portfolio of some other company. Surprisingly, we noticed that the top 10\u00a0companies, as much as they have performed the research in-house, have also bought a large number of patents from individual inventors or SMEs\u00a0to stay ahead in this innovation war.\nIn the next article of this series, we have shared the other side of the coin i.e. the small companies and individual inventors that are innovating the world of 4G LTE.

    "original_score": 2,
    "rm_score_original": 1.203125,
    "scraped_body": "The notifications began rolling in a week ago. \"I just stole @CaseyNewton on Stolen for \u00a7782,590 on @getstolen,\" went a typical tweet. I ignored the first few, but eventually curiosity got the better of me. I downloaded the app, Stolen, and saw that it had turned my Twitter profile into a trading card. Anyone who had an invite code to play the game could buy me so long as they had enough in-game currency. According to my profile, a PR person I\u2019m friendly with had scooped me up. Her profile listed me as part of her \"collection.\" And at the time, there was nothing I could do about it.In the days since Stolen\u2019s launch, it generated an outsized buzz for an app that had only around 40,000 people actively playing it. As recounted by Fortune, the game represented a last-ditch effort by developer Hey, Inc. to create a hit following the failure of Heyday, a journaling app that stalled out around 1 million downloads. But amid withering criticism over privacy concerns and the game\u2019s potential to enable abuse, the company pulled it from the App Store on Thursday evening. \"We\u2019ve heard everyone\u2019s concerns,\" the game\u2019s official account tweeted, \"and have decided the best thing to do is shut it down.\" Anyone who purchased in-game currency can get a refund through the App Store.\"We've heard everyone's concerns.\"Hey founder Siqi Chen told me he made the decision to shut the game down after concerns that it was negatively affecting some of its players, particularly those who were being \"stolen\" without their consent. \"Our goal with taking it down today has just been to make sure we stop what is happening \u2014 that we stop the harm, real and perceived, that people are getting from the existence of our product,\" he said. \"We didn't spend hours and months, sweat and tears to build something like this and have people see it this way. This is not who we are.\" Chen said the company had not yet decided what to work on next, but said it did not plan to revive the Stolen concept.Chen had previously founded Serious Business, a company built on Facebook\u2019s once-thriving games platform, and with Stolen his team decided to revisit their biggest hit from that era. Launched in 2007, Friends for Sale! was a popular Facebook game that let you \"buy\" your friends with in-game currency. In one creepy twist, the game referred to your friends as \"pets,\" and in another, it let you sell them to others for in-game profit. But there was no similar outcry about the game, or about the clones that followed it. \"That's one thing that surprised us,\" Chen said. Still, he said: \"That's an oversight on our part. The market changes. People's expectations change. And we didn't account for it.\"Chen pitched Friends for Sale! as a humorous app for socializing, though it profited by aggressively monetizing users\u2019 power fantasies. According to VentureBeat, the game\u2019s business model was born when a rich user offered Chen $10,000 for $1 million in in-game currency. More than 25 million people played Friends for Sale!, and one person eventually spent more than $70,000 building their digital human zoo. But the novelty eventually wore off, and Facebook's game platform deteriorated rapidly after it shut down the spammy tactics many games employed to acquire users. Serious Business never had a follow-up hit anywhere as big as Friends For Sale!, and Zynga acquired the company in 2010.Stolen was Friends for Sale! for the Twitter age. It mimicked the game\u2019s basic mechanic of buying and selling people in an effort to turn a virtual profit. It also let users buy in-game currency using real money. But instead of (only) acquiring friends, Stolen let you acquire celebrities, politicians, actors, investors, journalists, and brands. Anyone who uses Twitter, in other words.Stolen's premise contained the seeds of its demiseThe premise contained the seeds of Stolen\u2019s demise. Journalist Holly Brockwell gave voice to a number of concerns generated by the app in an interview with Chen published Wednesday. Chief among them: that it allowed strangers to trade users\u2019 names and likenesses without their permission; and that trolls could post abusive comments on profiles they had acquired. Chen apologized, and promised the company would closely monitor any abuse of the platform. It also created a way for users to opt out of having their profiles listed for stealing. But the next day, the company threw in the towel.Stolen\u2019s abrupt demise is likely to obscure the fact that for thousands of people, it was actually a lot of fun. I hated the idea of the app, but after I downloaded it I found myself playing every day. Stolen was addictive because it played on the anxieties so many of us have about Twitter and other social platforms. Who\u2019s following me? Who\u2019s ignoring me? Do my contributions here have any value? Are my peers more popular than I am? Stolen looked those worries in the eye and said, here\u2019s a giant stack of money \u2014 why not simply buy your way out? You couldn\u2019t make Justin Bieber follow you. But you could absolutely steal him.And indeed, I found myself buying profiles of people who I admire and who never followed me back. (Hi Felix Salmon!) When a high-profile person stole me, I felt a surge of pride. I compulsively checked my in-game value, which peaked around $1 million before edging steadily downward. And I relished stealing friends from other friends: a magnificent, harmless troll that always made me smile.\"We were trying to build a positive product, where people compliment and show how much they care about the people they care about,\" Chen said. \"I love Justin Bieber. I love Rihanna. William Shatner joined today! And William Shatner gets to say, I care about these people. These people I like. And he gets to see who his biggest fans are. That's the design we intended to build.\"All of this distracted from the fact that, as a game, Stolen felt rather pointless. There was no way to win, or, outside of spending lots of money, even to stay ahead. You could spend $1 million to steal someone only to have them stolen back from you seconds later. Once you acquired someone, the only thing you could do with their profile was to watch its value decline. The app\u2019s system for valuing users and distributing cash bonuses appeared for the most part to be entirely random.At first I wondered when Stolen\u2019s novelty would wear off. When it didn\u2019t, I wondered if Twitter would shut it down. (The company never said anything about Stolen, but Adam Bain, its chief operating officer, was an enthusiastic user.) What I never saw coming was that Chen would pull the plug himself. But pressure was mounting: Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA) sent letters to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Apple CEO Tim Cook today urging them to ban it.Every concern I read about Stolen in its short life, I shared. The last thing Twitter needs on its platform is a new way to enable abuse. And yet part of me is sad Stolen never got a chance to make it right. For willing participants, it was a flirty game of tag. And that, I think, is the crux of it. Had the game started by asking for our permission, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have had to ask our forgiveness.",

    "scraped_body": "I\u2019ve spent more than 5 years being a Bitcoin developer. The software I\u2019ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of developers, and the talks I\u2019ve given have led directly to the creation of several startups. I\u2019ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.From the start, I\u2019ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. So don\u2019t invest what you can\u2019t afford to lose. I\u2019ve said this in interviews, on stage at conferences, and over email. So have other well known developers like Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked \u201csystemically important institutions\u201d and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there\u2019s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.Think about it. If you had never heard about Bitcoin before, would you care about a payments network that:Couldn\u2019t move your existing moneyHad wildly unpredictable fees that were high and rising fastAllowed buyers to take back payments they\u2019d made after walking out of shops, by simply pressing a button (if you aren\u2019t aware of this \u201cfeature\u201d that\u2019s because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it)Is suffering large backlogs and flaky payments\u2026 which is controlled by China\u2026 and in which the companies and people building it were in open civil war?I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that the answer is no.Deadlock on the blocksIn case you haven\u2019t been keeping up with Bitcoin, here is how the network looks as of January 2016.The block chain is full. You may wonder how it is possible for what is essentially a series of files to be \u201cfull\u201d. The answer is that an entirely artificial capacity cap of one megabyte per block, put in place as a temporary kludge a long time ago, has not been removed and as a result the network\u2019s capacity is now almost completely exhausted.Here\u2019s a graph of block sizes.The peak level in July was reached during a denial-of-service attack in which someone flooded the network with transactions in an attempt to break things, calling it a \u201cstress test\u201d. So that level, about 700 kilobytes of transactions (or less than 3 payments per second), is probably about the limit of what Bitcoin can actually achieve in practiceNB: You may have read that the limit is 7 payments per second. That\u2019s an old figure from 2011 and Bitcoin transactions got a lot more complex since then, so the true figure is a lot lower.The reason the true limit seems to be 700 kilobytes instead of the theoretical 1000 is that sometimes miners produce blocks smaller than allowed and even empty blocks, despite that there are lots of transactions waiting to confirm \u2014 this seems to be most frequently caused by interference from the Chinese \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d censorship system. More on that in a second.If you look closely, you can see that traffic has been growing since the end of the 2015 summer months. This is expected. I wrote about Bitcoin\u2019s seasonal growth patterns back in March.Here\u2019s weekly average block sizes:So the average is nearly at the peak of what can be done. Not surprisingly then, there are frequent periods in which Bitcoin can\u2019t keep up with the transaction load being placed upon it and almost all blocks are the maximum size, even when there is a long queue of transactions waiting. You can see this in the size column (the 750kb blocks come from miners that haven\u2019t properly adjusted their software):When networks run out of capacity, they get really unreliable. That\u2019s why so many online attacks are based around simply flooding a target computer with traffic. Sure enough, just before Christmas payments started to become unreliable and at peak times backlogs are now becoming common.Quoting a news post by ProHashing, a Bitcoin-using business:Some customers contacted Chris earlier today asking why our bitcoin payouts didn\u2019t execute \u2026The issue is that it\u2019s now officially impossible to depend upon the bitcoin network anymore to know when or if your payment will be transacted, because the congestion is so bad that even minor spikes in volume create dramatic changes in network conditions. To whom is it acceptable that one could wait either 60 minutes or 14 hours, chosen at random?It\u2019s ludicrous that people are actually writing posts on reddit claiming that there is no crisis. People were criticizing my post yesterday on the grounds that I somehow overstated the seriousness of the situation. Do these people actually use the bitcoin network to send money everyday?ProHashing encountered another near-miss between Christmas and New Year, this time because a payment from an exchange to their wallet was delayed.Bitcoin is supposed to respond to this situation with automatic fee rises to try and get rid of some users, and although the mechanisms behind it are barely functional that\u2019s still sort of happening: it is rapidly becoming more and more expensive to use the Bitcoin network. Once upon a time, Bitcoin had the killer advantage of low and even zero fees, but it\u2019s now common to be asked to pay more to miners than a credit card would charge.Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.Why are they not allowing it to grow? Several reasons. One is that the developers of the \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d software that they run have refused to implement the necessary changes. Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as \u201cdisloyalty\u201d \u2014and they\u2019re terrified of doing anything that might make the news as a \u201csplit\u201d and cause investor panic. They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.And the final reason is that the Chinese internet is so broken by their government\u2019s firewall that moving data across the border barely works at all, with speeds routinely worse than what mobile phones provide. Imagine an entire country connected to the rest of the world by cheap hotel wifi, and you\u2019ve got the picture. Right now, the Chinese miners are able to \u2014 just about \u2014 maintain their connection to the global internet and claim the 25 BTC reward ($11,000) that each block they create gives them. But if the Bitcoin network got more popular, they fear taking part would get too difficult and they\u2019d lose their income stream. This gives them a perverse financial incentive to actually try and stop Bitcoin becoming popular.Many Bitcoin users and observers have been assuming up until very recently that somehow these problems would all sort themselves out, and of course the block chain size limit would be raised. After all, why would the Bitcoin community \u2026 the community that has championed the block chain as the future of finance \u2026 deliberately kill itself by strangling the chain in its crib? But that\u2019s exactly what is happening.The resulting civil war has seen Coinbase \u2014 the largest and best known Bitcoin startup in the USA \u2014 be erased from the official Bitcoin website for picking the \u201cwrong\u201d side and banned from the community forums. When parts of the community are viciously turning on the people that have introduced millions of users to the currency, you know things have got really crazy.Nobody knows what\u2019s going onIf you haven\u2019t heard much about this, you aren\u2019t alone. One of the most disturbing things that took place over the course of 2015 is that the flow of information to investors and users has dried up.In the span of only about eight months, Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners. This transformation is by far the most appalling thing I have ever seen, and the result is that I no longer feel comfortable being associated with the Bitcoin community.Bitcoin is not intended to be an investment and has always been advertised pretty accurately: as an experimental currency which you shouldn\u2019t buy more of than you can afford to lose. It is complex, but that never worried me because all the information an investor might want was out there, and there\u2019s an entire cottage industry of books, conferences, videos and websites to help people make sense of it all.That has now changed.Most people who own Bitcoin learn about it through the mainstream media. Whenever a story goes mainstream the Bitcoin price goes crazy, then the media report on the price rises and a bubble happens.Stories about Bitcoin reach newspapers and magazines through a simple process: the news starts in a community forum, then it\u2019s picked up by a more specialised community/tech news website, then journalists at general media outlets see the story on those sites and write their own versions. I\u2019ve seen this happen over and over again, and frequently taken part in it by discussing stories with journalists.In August 2015 it became clear that due to severe mismanagement, the \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d project that maintains the program that runs the peer-to-peer network wasn\u2019t going to release a version that raised the block size limit. The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT. By running XT, miners could cast a vote for changing the limit. Once 75% of blocks were voting for the change the rules would be adjusted and bigger blocks would be allowed.The release of Bitcoin XT somehow pushed powerful emotional buttons in a small number of people. One of them was a guy who is the admin of the bitcoin.org website and top discussion forums. He had frequently allowed discussion of outright criminal activity on the forums he controlled, on the grounds of freedom of speech. But when XT launched, he made a surprising decision. XT, he claimed, did not represent the \u201cdeveloper consensus\u201d and was therefore not really Bitcoin. Voting was an abomination, he said, because:\u201cOne of the great things about Bitcoin is its lack of democracy\u201dSo he decided to do whatever it took to kill XT completely, starting with censorship of Bitcoin\u2019s primary communication channels: any post that mentioned the words \u201cBitcoin XT\u201d was erased from the discussion forums he controlled, XT could not be mentioned or linked to from anywhere on the official bitcoin.org website and, of course, anyone attempting to point users to other uncensored forums was also banned. Massive numbers of users were expelled from the forums and prevented from expressing their views.As you can imagine, this enraged people. Read the comments on the announcement to get a feel for it.Eventually, some users found their way to a new uncensored forum. Reading it is a sad thing. Every day for months I have seen raging, angry posts railing against the censors, vowing that they will be defeated.But the inability to get news about XT or the censorship itself through to users has some problematic effects.For the first time, investors have no obvious way to get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on. Dissenting views are being systematically suppressed. Technical criticisms of what Bitcoin Core is doing are being banned, with misleading nonsense being peddled in its place. And it\u2019s clear that many people who casually bought into Bitcoin during one of its hype cycles have no idea that the system is about to hit an artificial limit.This worries me a great deal. Over the years governments have passed a large number of laws around securities and investments. Bitcoin is not a security and I do not believe it falls under those laws, but their spirit is simple enough: make sure investors are informed. When misinformed investors lose money, government attention frequently follows.Why is Bitcoin Core keeping the limit?People problems.When Satoshi left, he handed over the reins of the program we now call Bitcoin Core to Gavin Andresen, an early contributor. Gavin is a solid and experienced leader who can see the big picture. His reliable technical judgement is one of the reasons I had the confidence to quit Google (where I had spent nearly 8 years) and work on Bitcoin full time. Only one tiny problem: Satoshi never actually asked Gavin if he wanted the job, and in fact he didn\u2019t. So the first thing Gavin did was grant four other developers access to the code as well. These developers were chosen quickly in order to ensure the project could easily continue if anything happened to him. They were, essentially, whoever was around and making themselves useful at the time.One of them, Gregory Maxwell, had an unusual set of views: he once claimed he had mathematically proven Bitcoin to be impossible. More problematically, he did not believe in Satoshi\u2019s original vision.When the project was first announced, Satoshi was asked how a block chain could scale to a large number of payments. Surely the amount of data to download would become overwhelming if the idea took off? This was a popular criticism of Bitcoin in the early days and Satoshi fully expected to be asked about it. He said:The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think \u2026 if the network were to get [as big as VISA], it would take several years, and by then, sending [the equivalent of] 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.It\u2019s a simple argument: look at what existing payment networks handle, look at what it\u2019d take for Bitcoin to do the same, and then point out that growth doesn\u2019t happen overnight. The networks and computers of the future will be better than today. And indeed back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that, as he said to me, \u201cit never really hits a scale ceiling\u201d even when looking at more factors than just bandwidth.Maxwell did not agree with this line of thinking. From an interview in December 2014:Problems with decentralization as bitcoin grows are not going to diminish either, according to Maxwell: \u201cThere\u2019s an inherent tradeoff between scale and decentralization when you talk about transactions on the network.\u201dThe problem, he said, is that as bitcoin transaction volume increases, larger companies will likely be the only ones running bitcoin nodes because of the inherent cost.The idea that Bitcoin is inherently doomed because more users means less decentralisation is a pernicious one. It ignores the fact that despite all the hype, real usage is low, growing slowly and technology gets better over time. It is a belief Gavin and I have spent much time debunking. And it leads to an obvious but crazy conclusion: if decentralisation is what makes Bitcoin good, and growth threatens decentralisation, then Bitcoin should not be allowed to grow.Instead, Maxwell concluded, Bitcoin should become a sort of settlement layer for some vaguely defined, as yet un-created non-blockchain based system.The death spiral beginsIn a company, someone who did not share the goals of the organisation would be dealt with in a simple way: by firing him.But Bitcoin Core is an open source project, not a company. Once the 5 developers with commit access to the code had been chosen and Gavin had decided he did not want to be the leader, there was no procedure in place to ever remove one. And there was no interview or screening process to ensure they actually agreed with the project\u2019s goals.As Bitcoin became more popular and traffic started approaching the 1mb limit, the topic of raising the block size limit was occasionally brought up between the developers. But it quickly became an emotionally charged subject. Accusations were thrown around that raising the limit was too risky, that it was against decentralisation, and so on. Like many small groups, people prefer to avoid conflict. The can was kicked down the road.Complicating things further, Maxwell founded a company that then hired several other developers. Not surprisingly, their views then started to change to align with that of their new boss.Co-ordinating software upgrades takes time, and so in May 2015 Gavin decided the subject must be tackled once and for all, whilst there was still about 8 months remaining. He began writing articles that worked through the arguments against raising the limit, one at a time.But it quickly became apparent that the Bitcoin Core developers were hopelessly at loggerheads. Maxwell and the developers he had hired refused to contemplate any increase in the limit whatsoever. They were barely even willing to talk about the issue. They insisted that nothing be done without \u201cconsensus\u201d. And the developer who was responsible for making the releases was so afraid of conflict that he decided any controversial topic in which one side might \u201cwin\u201d simply could not be touched at all, and refused to get involved.Thus despite the fact that exchanges, users, wallet developers, and miners were all expecting a rise, and indeed, had been building entire businesses around the assumption that it would happen, 3 of the 5 developers refused to touch the limit.Deadlock.Meanwhile, the clock was ticking.Massive DDoS attacks on XT usersDespite the news blockade, within a few days of launching Bitcoin XT around 15% of all network nodes were running it, and at least one mining pool had started offering BIP101 voting to miners.That\u2019s when the denial of service attacks started. The attacks were so large that they disconnected entire regions from the internet:\u201cI was DDos\u2019d. It was a massive DDoS that took down my entire (rural) ISP. Everyone in five towns lost their internet service for several hours last summer because of these criminals. It definitely discouraged me from hosting nodes.\u201dIn other cases, entire datacenters were disconnected from the internet until the single XT node inside them was stopped. About a third of the nodes were attacked and removed from the internet in this way.Worse, the mining pool that had been offering BIP101 was also attacked and forced to stop. The message was clear: anyone who supported bigger blocks, or even allowed other people to vote for them, would be assaulted.The attackers are still out there. When Coinbase, months after the launch, announced they had finally lost patience with Core and would run XT, they too were forced offline for a while.Bogus conferencesDespite the DoS attacks and censorship, XT was gaining momentum. That posed a threat to Core, so a few of its developers decided to organise a series of conferences named \u201cScaling Bitcoin\u201d: one in August and one in December. The goal, it was claimed, was to reach \u201cconsensus\u201d on what should be done. Everyone likes a consensus of experts, don\u2019t they?It was immediately clear to me that people who refused to even talk about raising the limit would not have a change of heart because they attended a conference, and moreover, with the start of the winter growth season there remained only a few months to get the network upgraded. Wasting those precious months waiting for conferences would put the stability of the entire network at risk. The fact that the first conference actually banned discussion of concrete proposals didn\u2019t help.So I didn\u2019t go.Unfortunately, this tactic was devastatingly effective. The community fell for it completely. When talking to miners and startups, \u201cwe are waiting for Core to raise the limit in December\u201d was one of the most commonly cited reasons for refusing to run XT. They were terrified of any media stories about a community split that might hurt the Bitcoin price and thus, their earnings.Now the last conference has come and gone with no plan to raise the limit, some companies (like Coinbase and BTCC) have woken up to the fact that they got played. But too late. Whilst the community was waiting, organic growth added another 100,000 transactions per day.A non-roadmapJeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, the two of five Bitcoin Core committers who support a block size increase (and the two who have been around the longest), both have a stellar reputation within the community. They recently wrote a joint article titled \u201cBitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for Settlement\u201d.Jeff and Gavin are generally softer in their approach than I am. I\u2019m more of a tell-it-like-I-see-it kinda guy, or as Gavin has delicately put it, \u201chonest to a fault\u201d. So the strong language in their joint letter is unusual. They don\u2019t pull any punches:The proposed roadmap currently being discussed in the bitcoin community has some good points in that it does have a plan to accommodate more transactions, but it fails to speak plainly to bitcoin users and acknowledge key downsides.Core block size does not change; there has been zero compromise on that issue.In an optimal, transparent, open source environment, a BIP would be produced \u2026 this has not happenedOne of the explicit goals of the Scaling Bitcoin workshops was to funnel the chaotic core block size debate into an orderly decision making process. That did not occur. In hindsight, Scaling Bitcoin stalled a block size decision while transaction fee price and block space pressure continue to increase.Failing to speak plainly, as they put it, has become more and more common. As an example, the plan Gavin and Jeff refer to was announced at the \u201cScaling Bitcoin\u201d conferences but doesn\u2019t involve making anything more efficient, and manages an anemic 60% capacity increase only through an accounting trick (not counting some of the bytes in each transaction). It requires making huge changes to nearly every piece of Bitcoin-related software. Instead of doing a simple thing and raising the limit, it chooses to do an incredibly complicated thing that might buy months at most, assuming a huge coordinated effort.Replace by feeOne problem with using fees to control congestion is that the fee to get to the front of the queue might change after you made a payment. Bitcoin Core has a brilliant solution to this problem \u2014 allow people to mark their payments as changeable after they\u2019ve been sent, up until they appear in the block chain. The stated intention is to let people adjust the fee paid, but in fact their change also allows people to change the payment to point back to themselves, thus reversing it.At a stroke, this makes using Bitcoin useless for actually buying things, as you\u2019d have to wait for a buyer\u2019s transaction to appear in the block chain \u2026 which from now on can take hours rather than minutes, due to the congestion.Core\u2019s reasoning for why this is OK goes like this: it\u2019s no big loss because if you hadn\u2019t been waiting for a block before, there was a theoretical risk of payment fraud, which means you weren\u2019t using Bitcoin properly. Thus, making that risk a 100% certainty doesn\u2019t really change anything.In other words, they don\u2019t recognise that risk management exists and so perceive this change as zero cost.This protocol change will be released with the next version of Core (0.12), so will activate when the miners upgrade. It was massively condemned by the entire Bitcoin community but the remaining Bitcoin Core developers don\u2019t care what other people think, so the change will happen.If that didn\u2019t convince you Bitcoin has serious problems, nothing will. How many people would think bitcoins are worth hundreds of dollars each when you soon won\u2019t be able to use them in actual shops?ConclusionsBitcoin has entered exceptionally dangerous waters. Previous crises, like the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, were all to do with the services and companies that sprung up around the ecosystem. But this one is different: it is a crisis of the core system, the block chain itself.More fundamentally, it is a crisis that reflects deep philosophical differences in how people view the world: either as one that should be ruled by a \u201cconsensus of experts\u201d, or through ordinary people picking whatever policies make sense to them.Even if a new team was built to replace Bitcoin Core, the problem of mining power being concentrated behind the Great Firewall would remain. Bitcoin has no future whilst it\u2019s controlled by fewer than 10 people. And there\u2019s no solution in sight for this problem: nobody even has any suggestions. For a community that has always worried about the block chain being taken over by an oppressive government, it is a rich irony.Still, all is not yet lost. Despite everything that has happened, in the past few weeks more members of the community have started picking things up from where I am putting them down. Where making an alternative to Core was once seen as renegade, there are now two more forks vying for attention (Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited). So far they\u2019ve hit the same problems as XT but it\u2019s possible a fresh set of faces could find a way to make progress.There are many talented and energetic people working in the Bitcoin space, and in the past five years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of getting to know many of them. Their entrepreneurial spirit and alternative perspectives on money, economics and politics were fascinating to experience, and despite how it\u2019s all gone down I don\u2019t regret my time with the project. I woke up this morning to find people wishing me well in the uncensored forum and asking me to stay, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve moved on to other things. To those people I say: good luck, stay strong, and I wish you the best.",

Founded in 1962 by American Formula One racers Hap Sharp and Jim Hall, it was named after the roadrunner, a fast-running ground cuckoo also known as a chaparral bird.\n\n\n\nDick Troutman and Tom Barnes were builders of the original Chaparral race cars (later referred to as Chaparral 1).[1]  Jim Hall purchased two Chaparral 1s to race.  When Hall and Sharp began building their own cars, they asked Troutman and Barnes if they could continue to use the Chaparral name.  That is why the Hall/Sharp cars are all named Chaparral 2s (models 2A through 2J for sports cars/CanAm cars, and the 2K which was the 1979\u20131982 Indycar).  Despite winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1980, they left motor racing in 1982.  Chaparral cars also featured in the SCCA/CASC Can-Am series and Endurance racing.[citation needed]\nJim Hall  was a leader in the innovation and design of spoilers, wings, and ground effects.  A high point was the 1966 2E Can-Am car.  The 2J Can-Am \"sucker car\" was the first \"ground-effect\" car.[citation needed]\nThe development of the Chaparral chronicles the key changes in race cars in the 1960s and 1970s in both aerodynamics and tires. Hall's training as an engineer taught him to approach problems in a methodical manner, and his access to the engineering teams at Chevrolet and at Firestone was instrumental in changing race car aerodynamics and handling from an art to an empirical science. The embryonic data acquisition systems created by the GM research and development group aided these efforts. An interview with Hall by Paul Haney illustrates many of these developments.[2]\n\n\n\nChaparral 1 front\nIn 1957, Hall raced the front-engined Chaparral (retroactively called the \"Chaparral 1\") through 1962, bought from Troutman and Barnes (like the Scarab, the Chaparral 1 cars were built in California by Troutman and Barnes). Hall and Hap Sharp extensively modified their Chaparral and eventually decided to build their own car. They obtained permission from Troutman and Barnes to use the Chaparral name, which is why all of Hall's cars are called Chaparral 2s.\n\n\n\nThe Chaparral 2A at the 2005 Monterey Historic\nJoakim Bonnier 1966 in the Chaparral 2D during practice at the N\u00fcrburgring\nThe Chaparral 2E\nMike Spence 1967 in the Chaparral 2F during practice at the N\u00fcrburgring\nThe Chaparral 2H at the 2005 Monterey Historic\nThe first Chaparral 2-series was designed and built to compete in the United States Road Racing Championship and other races of the time, particularly the West Coast Pro Series that were held each fall.  Hall had significant \"under the table\" assistance from GM, including engineering and technical support in the development of the car and its automatic transmission (this is evidenced by the similarity between the Chevy Corvette GS-II \"research and development\" model and the Chaparral 2A through 2C models).\nFirst raced in late 1963, the Chaparral 2 developed into a highly competitive car in the Can-Am series in 1966 and 1967. Designed for the 200-mile races of the Can-Am series, it was also a winner in longer endurance races.  In 1965, it shocked the sports car world by winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in a pouring rainstorm, on one of the roughest tracks in North America.\nThe Chaparral 2 featured the innovative use of fiberglass as a chassis material. The Chaparral 2C had a conventional aluminum chassis.\nIt is very difficult to identify all iterations of the car as new ideas were being tested continually.\n\nThe 2A is the car as originally raced, featuring a very conventional sharp edge to cut through the air. It also featured a concave tail reminiscent of the theories of Wunibald Kamm. The first aerodynamic appendages began to appear on the 2A almost immediately to cure an issue with the front end being very light at speed with a consequent impact on steering accuracy and driver confidence.\nAs the car evolved, it grew and changed shape. Most call these 2B and were raced through the end of 1965.\nThe 2C introduced the innovative in-car adjustable rear wing. The integrated spoiler-wing was designed to lie flat for low drag on the straights and tip-up under braking through the corners. The car's clutchless, semi-automatic transmission kept the driver's left foot free to operate the wing mechanism. The 2C was based on a Chevrolet-designed aluminum chassis and was a smaller car in every dimension than the 2B. Without the natural non-resonant damping of the fiberglass chassis, Hap Sharp nicknamed it the EBJ\u00a0\u2014 \"eyeball jiggler\".\nAlongside the development of aerodynamics was Hall's development of race tires. Jim Hall owned Rattlesnake Raceway, located adjacent to his race shop; its proximity allowed him to participate in much of Firestone's race tire development.\nA two-article series in Car and Driver magazine featured Hall's design theories, turning speculation about vehicle handling into applied physics. Hall's theories were the precursor to the elaborate data collection and management of current racing teams.\nThe 2D was the first closed cockpit variant of the 2-series, designed for endurance racing in 1966. It won at 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring in 1966 with Phil Hill and Joakim Bonnier driving. It also competed in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, withdrawing after 111 laps. The 2D was equipped with a 327 cubic-inch displacement (5.3-liter) aluminum alloy Chevrolet engine producing 420 horsepower; the car weighed only 924\u00a0kg.\nThe 2E was based on the Chevrolet-designed aluminum 2C chassis and presented Hall's most advanced aerodynamic theories to the racing world in 1966. The 2E established the paradigm for virtually all racing cars built since.[3] It was startling in appearance, with its radiators moved from the traditional location in the nose to two ducted pods on either side of the cockpit and a large pivoting variable-incidence wing-mounted several feet above the rear of the car on struts. As opposed to an aircraft wing, it generated downforce instead of lift and was attached directly to the rear suspension uprights, loading the tires for extra adhesion while cornering. A ducted nose channeled air from the front of the car upwards, creating extra downforce as well. By depressing a floor pedal that was in the position of the clutch in other cars, Hall was able to feather or flatten out, the \"normally\" negative-incidence wing's angle when downforce was not needed (as on a straight track section) to reduce drag and increase top speed. An interconnected air dam also closed off the nose ducting for streamlining. When the pedal was released, the front ducting and wing returned to full downforce position. Until they were banned, many race cars, including some in Formula One, had wings on tall struts. The resulting accidents from their failures led to pivoting wings mounted on the suspension prior to being fully banned.\nThe 2E scored only one win, at the 1966 Laguna Seca Raceway Can-Am with Hill driving. Hall stuck to an aluminum 5.3-liter Chevrolet engine in his lightweight racer while the other teams were using 6- to 7-liter iron engines, trading weight for power.\nThe 2E was a crowd favorite and remains Hall's favorite car.\nIn the 2F Hall applied the aerodynamic advances of the aluminum 2E to the older fiberglass chassis closed-cockpit 2D for the 1967 racing season. A movable wing mounted on struts loaded the rear suspension while an air dam kept the front end planted. The radiators were moved to positions next to the cockpit.[4] An aluminum 7-liter Chevrolet 'big block' engine replaced the 5.3-liter engine of the 2D. While always extremely fast, the extra power of the larger engine was too much for the automatic transmission to handle and it broke with regularity. After solving the transmission problems, the 2F scored its only win on 30 July 1967 in the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch with Hill and Mike Spence driving.[4] After this race the FIA changed its rules, outlawing not only the 2F but also the Ford GT40 Mk.IV (winner at Le Mans that year) and the Ferrari 330 P3/4 (winner, 24 Hours of Daytona) and 365 P4 (finished second, Le Mans).[4] As with the 2D, the 2F raced wearing Texas license plates.\nThe 1967 2G was a development of the 2E. It featured wider tires and a 427 cu in aluminum Chevrolet V-8 engine. While on par with its competitors in terms of power, the lightweight 2C chassis was stretched to the limit and it was only Hall's driving skills that kept the car competitive. For the 1968 Can-Am series, still larger tires were added to increase grip.\nHall's racing career was effectively ended in a severe crash at the Stardust Grand Prix Can-Am race when he rear-ended the slow-moving McLaren of Lothar Motschenbacher, although he did drive in the 1970 Trans-American Sedan Championship while fielding a team of Chevrolet Camaros.\n\nHall noted that the increasing downforce also created enormous drag. Seeking a competitive edge, the highly advanced 2H was built in 1968 as the replacement for the 2G to minimize drag.  Not only was it extremely slippery, it was narrow to reduce frontal area.  Development problems kept it out of the Can Am series, forcing Hall to update the 2G for the 1968 series, during which his catastrophic accident occurred.  Hall was consistently the best driver for Chaparral and knew how to get the best out of his cars.  John Surtees was brought in as driver for the 1969 Can Am series but never figured out how to drive the 2H to take advantage of its low drag potential.  Surtees complained he couldn't see out of the car and demanded a redesign which ruined the aerodynamics, then ran the rear wing almost upright, negating any advantage of the compact slippery shape.  Ultimately, by 1969 the massive amount of power being generated from the big block Chevrolet engines that Hall effectively debugged in 1967 and 1968, downforce was more important than low drag.  Had the 2H kept the low drag shape but with a wider track it most likely would have been very competitive, but the true monocoque construction made changes to the chassis almost impossible.  Beautifully constructed, the 2H looks as if it was made by NASA.\n\nThe Chaparral 2J at the Goodwood Festival of Speed\nThe most unusual Chaparral was the 2J. On the chassis' sides bottom edges were articulated Lexan plastic skirts that sealed against the ground (a technology that would later appear in Formula One). Two fans adapted from a military tank engine were housed at the rear, driven by a single two-stroke twin-cylinder engine.[5] The skirting produced a zone within which the fans could create a vacuum producing downforce on the order of 1.25 to 1.50 g when the car was fully loaded (fuel, oil, coolant). Tremendous gripping power and greater maneuverability at all speeds were produced.[6][7][8][9][10]\nThe 2J competed in the Can-Am series and qualified at least two seconds quicker than the next fastest car, but mechanical problems limited its success. It only ran in the 1970 season, after which it was outlawed by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA). Although originally approved by the SCCA, they succumbed to pressure from other teams who argued that the fans constituted \"movable aerodynamic devices\". Sanctioning body FIA had banned such devices beginning with the 2E. There were also complaints of debris generated by the fans damaging the following cars. McLaren argued that if the 2J were not outlawed, the Can-Am series would be ruined by its dominance \u2013 something McLaren had been doing since 1967.[11] A similar fan was used in Formula One in 1978 on the Brabham BT46B.[12][13][14][15]\n\n\nChaparral 2K on display in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum\nThe 2K was a Formula One-inspired ground effect Indy car designed by Briton John Barnard. Debuting in 1979 with driver Al Unser Sr., it went on to win six races in 27 starts over three seasons. Its greatest success came in 1980 when Johnny Rutherford won both the Indy 500 and CART championship.[16][17][18][19][20][21]\n\n\n\nChaparral started fielding Indy cars in 1978 with Al Unser driving the No. 2 First National City Traveler's Checks Lola T500-Cosworth DFX. Unser then managed to win the 1978 Indianapolis 500. Later in the season Unser added wins at the California 500 at Ontario Motor Speedway and the Schaefer 500 at Pocono International Raceway; this remains the only time a driver has won the Triple Crown. Despite these wins, Unser lost the championship to Tom Sneva (who failed to win a race). With the formation of CART, Hall fielded Unser in the No. 2 Pennzoil Lola T500-Cosworth DFX. At the 1979 Indianapolis 500, Hall and fellow CART board men Roger Penske, Pat Patrick, Teddy Mayer, Ted Field, and Robert Fletcher were initially not allowed to compete in the race since it was part of the USAC National Championship. At the same time Hall was going to introduce the Chaparral 2K-Cosworth DFX. In the race Unser lead for 89 of the 200 laps but an engine fire on lap 105 ended his participation. He later won the season-ending Miller High Life 150 at Phoenix International Raceway and  finished fifth in CART standings but was ineligible for USAC points.\n\n\nBy 1980 Unser was replaced by Johnny Rutherford after having disagreements with Hall. The only change to 2K was its number, now four. Rutherford won five races that season, including the 1980 Indianapolis 500, the Datsun Twin 200 at Ontario Motor Speedway, the Red Roof Inn 150 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course; the Norton 200 at Michigan International Speedway, and the Tony Bettenhausen 200 at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Speedway. He also won the 1980 IndyCar and CRL championships. In 1981 Rutherford returned with the No. 1 Pennzoil Chaparral 2K-Cosworth DFX and won the season-opening Kraco Car Stereos 150 at Phoenix International Raceway. The rest of the season proved to be inconsistent as he dropped to fifth in points. The team also competed in the opening round of the USAC Gold Crown season at the 1981 Indianapolis 500. Rutherford led for three laps early on but fuel pump issues ended the team's day after only 25 laps. By the 1982 IndyCar season the 2K was becoming outdated, with its best result in fourth place at the Miller High Life 150. After four races he ranked 18th in points. By the time of the Norton Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway, the team was using a March 82C-Cosworth DFX purchased from Bob Fletcher Racing. Rutherford's results managed to improve as he took his season-best finish of third at the AirCal 500K at Riverside International Raceway. Rutherford ended up in 12th place in points that year. The team also competed at the USAC Gold Crown season finale, the 1982 Indianapolis 500, where Rutherford started 12th and finished 8th.\n\n\nIn the 1991 CART season Hall returned to Indy cars in conjunction with VDS Racing, with the team being called Hall-VDS Racing with John Andretti driving the No. 4 Pennzoil Z-7 Lola T91/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8. The team managed to get a victory in their debut, the Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix on the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit. The team also got a second-place finish at the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at the Milwaukee Mile. Also, at the 1991 Indianapolis 500 Andretti got a fifth-place finish. At the end of the season Andretti was ranked a career-best eighth in points. In the 1992 CART season Andretti drove the No. 8 Pennzoil Z-7 Lola T92/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8 for the team. However, Andretti's best finish came at the Pioneer Electronics 200 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course where he came in fourth place. At the end of the year Andretti finished eighth in points again. He then left the team at the end of the season to compete in the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series for Jack Clark. So in the 1993 CART season the team fielded Teo Fabi in the No. 8 Pennzoil Lola T93/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8. Fabi's best finish was fourth, at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on his way to an 11th-place finish in points. In the 1994 CART season Fabi drove the No. 11 Pennzoil Reynard 94i-Ilmor D. Fabi's best results that season were a pair of fourth-place finishes at the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway and the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America. Fabi went on to end the season ranked ninth in points. At the end of the season he left to drive for Forsythe Racing. For the 1995 CART season VDS dropped out of the venture and the team became known as Hall Racing and rookie Gil de Ferran was signed on to pilot the No. 8 Pennzoil Reynard 95i-Ilmor-Mercedes-Benz IC108. In four of the first six races de Ferran  managed to qualify in the top-10. Although he only scored two points during that time. His season soon turned around starting with a pole position at the Budweiser Grand Prix of Cleveland at Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport where he was leading with five laps to go when he collided with the lapped car of Scott Pruett taking him out of the race. De Ferran avenged this later in the season when he won the season-ending Toyota Monterey Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway. He finished 14th in points and won the Jim Trueman PPG IndyCar World Series Rookie of the Year Award. For the 1996 IndyCar season he drove the No. 8 Pennzoil Reynard 96i-Honda Indy V8 and qualified for the pole at the 1996 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. He also won the Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland and finished sixth in the final points standings. Despite the recent success Hall closed up the Indy car team for good, after which de Ferran drove for Walker Racing in the 1997 CART season. In total Hall won 13 races and two championships.\n\nMuseum entrance to the Chaparral display\n\nIn 2005, a wing of the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, Texas, was dedicated to the permanent display of the remaining Chaparral cars and the history of their development. The cars are driven from time to time at the museum grounds to keep them running properly.\n\n\nThe 2005 Monterey Historic Automobile Races honored Chaparrals as the featured marque. Hall's Chaparral 2A won the Monterey Sports Car Championships at Laguna Seca Raceway in 1964.[22]\nIn the 2009 Monterey Sports Car Championships, Gil de Ferran painted his Acura ARX-02a to resemble a Chaparral in tribute to Jim Hall, for whose team he drove in his first two seasons in CART, and also to commemorate his final professional race. An exhibition race featuring the Acura and three Chaparrals was held that Friday with Hall performed a demonstration lap shortly before the race.\n\n\n\nYear\n\nCar\n\nImage\n\nCategory\n\n\n1958\n\nChaparral 1\n\n\n\nSports car racing\n\n\n1963\n\nChaparral 2A\n\n\n\nSports prototype\n\n\n1965\n\nChaparral 2C\n\n\n\nSports prototype\n\n\n1966\n\nChaparral 2D\n\n\n\nGroup 6\n\n\nChaparral 2E\n\n\n\nGroup 7\n\n\n1967\n\nChaparral 2F\n\n\n\nGroup 6\n\n\nChaparral 2G\n\n\n\nGroup 6\n\n\n1968\n\nChaparral 2H\n\n\n\nGroup 7\n\n\n1970\n\nChaparral 2J\n\n\n\nGroup 7\n\n\n1979\n\nChaparral 2K\n\n\n\nIndyCar\n\nComplete PPG CART Indycar World Series results[edit]\n(key)\n\n\n\nYear\n\nChassis\n\nEngine\n\nDrivers\n\nNo.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nPts Pos\n\nPos\n\n\nChaparral Cars\n\n\n1979\n\n\n\nPHX\n\nATL\n\nINDY\n\nTRT\n\nMCH\n\nWGL\n\nTRT\n\nONT\n\nMCH\n\nATL\n\nPHX\n\n\n\n\nLola T500\n\nCosworth DFX\n\n Al Unser\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n2,163\n\n\nChaparral 2K\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n2\n\n12\n\n13\n\n3\n\n5\n\n\n\n5\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLola T500\n\n Dennis Firestone (R)\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNC\n\n\u2014\n\n\n1980\n\n\n\nONT\n\nINDY\n\nMIL\n\nPOC\n\nMDO\n\nMCH\n\nWGL\n\nMIL\n\nONT\n\nMCH\n\nMXC\n\nPHX\n\n\n\n\nChaparral 2K\n\nCosworth DFX\n\n Johnny Rutherford\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n4,723\n\n\n1981\n\n\n\nPHX\n\nMIL\n\nATL\n\nMCH\n\nRIV\n\nMIL\n\nMCH\n\nWGL\n\nMXC\n\nPHX\n\n\n\n\nChaparral 2K\n\nCosworth DFX\n\n Johnny Rutherford\n\n1\n\n1*\n\n6\n\n2*\n\n3\n\n22\n\n21\n\n4\n\n20\n\n2\n\n26\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n120\n\n\n1982\n\n\n\nPHX\n\nATL\n\nMIL\n\nCLE\n\nMCH\n\nMIL\n\nPOC\n\nRIV\n\nROA\n\nMCH\n\nPHX\n\n\n\n\nChaparral 2K\n\nCosworth DFX\n\n Johnny Rutherford\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\n\n15\n\n23\n\n28\n\n17\n\n12\n\n3\n\n12\n\nDNS\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12th\n\n62\n\n\nHall-VDS Racing\n\n\n1991\n\n\n\nSFR\n\nLBH\n\nPHX\n\nINDY\n\nMIL\n\nDET\n\nPOR\n\nCLE\n\nMEA\n\nTOR\n\nMCH\n\nDEN\n\nVAN\n\nMDO\n\nROA\n\nNAZ\n\nLAG\n\n\n\n\nLola T91/00\n\nChevrolet 265A\n\n John Andretti\n\n5\n\n1\n\n18\n\n11\n\n5\n\n2\n\n6\n\n19\n\n15\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n10\n\n19\n\n9\n\n19\n\n8th\n\n105\n\n\n1992\n\n\n\nSFR\n\nPHX\n\nLBH\n\nINDY\n\nDET\n\nPOR\n\nMIL\n\nNHA\n\nTOR\n\nMCH\n\nCLE\n\nROA\n\nVAN\n\nMDO\n\nNAZ\n\nLAG\n\n\n\n\nLola T92/00\n\nChevrolet 265A\n\n John Andretti\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n20\n\n8\n\n21\n\n5\n\n9\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6\n\n12\n\n6\n\n15\n\n4\n\n18\n\n5\n\n\n\n8th\n\n94\n\n\n Didier Theys\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40th\n\n0\n\n\n1993\n\n\n\nSFR\n\nPHX\n\nLBH\n\nINDY\n\nMIL\n\nDET\n\nPOR\n\nCLE\n\nTOR\n\nMCH\n\nNHA\n\nROA\n\nVAN\n\nMDO\n\nNAZ\n\nLAG\n\n\n\n\nLola T93/07\n\nChevrolet 265C\n\n Teo Fabi\n\n8\n\n9\n\n5\n\n4\n\n9\n\n9\n\n22\n\n25\n\n8\n\n14\n\n6\n\n16\n\n8\n\n8\n\n24\n\n11\n\n8\n\n\n\n11th\n\n64\n\n\n1994\n\n\n\nSFR\n\nPHX\n\nLBH\n\nINDY\n\nMIL\n\nDET\n\nPOR\n\nCLE\n\nTOR\n\nMCH\n\nMDO\n\nNHA\n\nVAN\n\nROA\n\nNAZ\n\nLAG\n\n\n\n\nReynard 94i\n\nIlmor 265D\n\n Teo Fabi\n\n11\n\n7\n\n26\n\n9\n\n7\n\n17\n\n4\n\n27\n\n9\n\n8\n\n4\n\n21\n\n20\n\n18\n\n4\n\n6\n\n5\n\n\n\n9th\n\n79\n\n\nJim Hall Racing\n\n\n1995\n\n\n\nMIA\n\nSFR\n\nPHX\n\nLBH\n\nNAZ\n\nINDY\n\nMIL\n\nDET\n\nPOR\n\nROA\n\nTOR\n\nCLE\n\nMCH\n\nMDO\n\nNHA\n\nVAN\n\nLAG\n\n\n\n\nReynard 95i\n\nMercedes-Benz IC108B\n\n Gil de Ferran (R)\n\n8\n\n25\n\n16\n\n11\n\n27\n\n19\n\n29\n\n8\n\n16\n\n10\n\n21\n\n16\n\n14*\n\n12\n\n24\n\n7\n\n2\n\n1*\n\n14th\n\n56\n\n\n1996\n\n\n\nMIA\n\nRIO\n\nSFR\n\nLBH\n\nNAZ\n\n500\n\nMIL\n\nDET\n\nPOR\n\nCLE\n\nTOR\n\nMCH\n\nMDO\n\nROA\n\nVAN\n\nLAG\n\n\n\n\nReynard 96i\n\nHonda HRH V8t\n\n Gil de Ferran\n\n8\n\n2\n\n10\n\n11\n\n5*\n\n23\n\n9\n\n9\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1*\n\n18\n\n19\n\n17\n\n25\n\n4\n\n25\n\n\n\n6th\n\n104\n\nJim Hall Racing -

    "scraped_body": "I never thought that this day will come when I need to worry about what Google is doing. I don\u2019t know why anyone would want Google to control what it wants you to see but Google has a feature to do that!  Let me explain, my wife bought me a new phone a few days ago and I started playing with it. The default browsers are usually not what I want so I decided to switch to Chrome as my default browser. I was fiddling with the setting on Chrome and found a feature that I had not noticed before. The feature is called \u2018Data Saver\u2019. When I enabled it, it promised to help me save some bandwidth so I happily accepted it. The feature pointed out to me that HTTPS connections will not be optimized which seem acceptable at the time.  At my office, the next day I decided to use my new phone to test it out with MB\u2122 with this feature enabled. To my horror, no traffic was registered by MB\u2122. However, my phone was able to still reached the contents of my site. I tried it a few times and then it hit me, I understood what was happening. Google Analytics (GA) showed the traffic hit but the traffic never really got to my site. Google was crawling my site (which I allowed on MB\u2122) and caching the contents. When my browser requested for the page, Google Chrome did not go to my site rather it fetched the page from their own cache and updated GA!  That may sound harmless at first glance for the sake of saving a few bytes on my phone but the implications are far reaching. Many of my friends and family know nuts about technology so for them enabling a feature like this when there is no explanation of what is going on at the background is a real cause for worry. Thankfully, this feature is not turned on by default for now! Lets give Google the benefit of doubt that they are trying to do good and save the world but still my worry is that bad things happen on the Internet all the time. Just imagine if the cache that Google has was hacked and filled with porn. You are with your family and about to go visit your Church website for last week\u2019s sermon and out comes an orgy picture with your entire family staring at the screen together with you. This is the best case scenario in the case when bad things happen.  Lets take that thought even further and imagine the worst case scenario. If one day Google Chrome ruled the web. Google now has the power to decide how many visitors go to your site and that includes what content they allow your visitors to see on your website. If they needed some advertisements to be inserted into your page, they could easily do that at a click of the finger. You can try all you want on your web server to fix it but in reality there is nothing you will be able to do about it.  You may argue that using HTTPS solves all the problem, but many people in the 3rd world nations can\u2019t afford these type of privileges. This feature actually penalizes the poor more than the well to do. It simply puts those who cannot afford such privileges at greater risk while trying to \u2018promote\u2019 better security practices such as using HTTPS. I know it is a tough problem and I am not trying to solve it. All that I am pointing out is that if you use Google Chrome, make sure you know what is happening and the risks that is involved in using such a feature!",

They\u2019re earnest and committed to building positive things. Some of them are donors to my organization, for which I\u2019m immensely grateful. It\u2019s clear that Silicon Valley is today more than ever the center of innovation and technological progress.That said, there are a few things about it that are starting to make me nervous.I\u2019ve had several friends tell me that they\u2019re leaving the Valley because they want to rejoin the real world. A successful entrepreneur told me he fantasizes about leaving because he wants to raise his kids the way he was raised in Rochester, and that his money would effectively triple as soon as he left. Another successful entrepreneur who moved to San Francisco said he felt like \u201cjust another cow in the pen,\u201d and that he enjoyed spending time in other parts of the country because it made him feel more like he was making a difference.What are these people talking about? What are the things that are starting to freak people out about Silicon Valley? There are a few themes that come up again and again:The epicenter of wealth and young moneyThere are a lot of young people, generally from very good colleges, making more money than most people will ever see. These are summer college interns (non-engineers) who are being paid $7,000+ a month and getting perks like free flights home to visit on weekends. Bidding wars and five and six-digit signing bonuses are being paid out for\u00a0freshly minted engineering grads, particularly from Stanford. Average salaries are now close to $200,000 in the Valley, to say nothing of the upside of equity-based compensation, which can be dramatically higher.All of the above makes business sense\u2014I\u2019d offer the same thing to a young person whom I thought could potentially be a difference-maker. But it\u2019s a lot relatively early in people\u2019s careers.SupercompetitiveTechnology companies tend to operate in winner-take-all spaces and thus adopt a very high-commitment culture. That is, if there are 10 or 100 mapping apps or social networks, the one company left standing is worth billions, and the rest are worth a very small fraction of that (probably only what people will pay for the talent on hand). As a result, the organizations are ultra-efficient and expect long hours and constant availability. It\u2019s either win or lose big for a lot of companies, and there\u2019s not much in-between.Hard work is awesome. But when you see an army of people staring at their computer screens in the evening post-dinnertime, it\u2019s a little eerie.War for talentIf you want to win big, you have to get the best troops. Well-resourced tech companies are now on the hunt for talent like never before, building massive recruitment pipelines to hoover up top prospects and engineers. Google recruits the heck out of Stanford, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and other top schools offering six-figures to start, plus bonuses. Facebook sponsors hackathons at the top schools, stays in touch with professors, and invests tons of resources in order to be the most visible and obvious employer.Don\u2019t think that the smart kids haven\u2019t noticed\u2014the proportion of Stanford students majoring in the Humanities has plummeted from over 20% to only 7% this past year, prompting wails among History and English professors whose classes no longer have students. One administrator joked to me that Stanford is now the Stanford Institute of Technology. In 2014, more Harvard Business School Grads went into technology than into banking for the first time since the dot-com era.Again, I\u2019d do the same thing. But is this the optimal assignment of our best and brightest? And is it a good thing that one of our nation\u2019s top universities seems to be going vocational?Insular culture/Not awesome at diversityThe corporate campuses and workplace amenities of Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. are legendary. They\u2019re insider tourist attractions. For the average employee, you wake up and drive from a leafy suburb to a grounded spaceship. You stay there and eat the subsidized gourmet dinner with someone who\u2019s a lot like you. Or maybe you take the dark-windowed company bus from San Francisco and tap out emails with headphones on. Even smaller companies are competing on rock climbing walls and ping-pong tables.This way of life doesn\u2019t generally expose you to people who are living different ways of life. And the people on the bus and spaceship aren\u2019t representative of most of society based on gender\u00a0or\u00a0race\u00a0or education or age. \u201cSilicon Valley is a bubble\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to valuations or money\u2014it refers to the fact that you live in a bubble.Crazy high cost of livingSimply put, it will blow your mind what things cost in terms of housing in the Bay Area right now. Modest houses for well over a million dollars. Little apartments the same. One bedroom apartments start at over $3,000/month. The average home in Santa Clara county sold for $1.25 million in August of 2015, up 9% from last year. How is a teacher or just about any regular person going to live there?Even if you can afford to live in a neighborhood, the elevated costs make it easy to compare yourself to others and say, \u201cWell, sure I\u2019m richer than anyone I grew up with, but I\u2019m not that rich, because look at that guy I work with or went to school with or who lives down the block. That guy\u2019s really rich.\u201d It\u2019s not an environment of plenty, but one of keeping up with the Joneses.These are some of the things that are making people uncomfortable both in and about the Valley. None of these issues are anyone\u2019s fault. It\u2019s just the market at work\u2014the capital market, the market for talent, the real estate market.It reminds me a fair amount of Wall Street. Wall Street\u2019s public image took a hit post-financial crisis in part because they were bailed out by the government, in part because they contributed to the crisis, and in part because they don\u2019t produce tangible goods and services (no one got as mad at Chrysler, for example).But another reason Wall Street had trouble maintaining goodwill was because of some of the attributes above\u2014hard-charging, too much too soon, parallel reality, money flowing everywhere, rich white guys, etc. To use a sports metaphor, it\u2019s\u00a0like the Yankees or Duke University or the Patriots\u2014they start getting hard to root for, unless they\u2019re your home team.Solve the big problemsPerhaps the biggest critique of Silicon Valley comes from a technologist quoted in Vanity Fair\u2019s recent article by Nick Bilton\u2014\u201cSF tech culture is focused on solving one problem: What is my mother no longer doing for me?\u201dGetting a car on demand, finding something online, business productivity tools, connecting with people\u2014these are solutions that the market demands and rewards. They make money. Silicon Valley is like Wall Street in that it will fill and pursue market opportunities to their logical extremes.If there\u2019s one way that Silicon Valley can lead and distance\u00a0itself from critiques of insularity and out-of-touchness, it\u2019s to tackle the big, thorny, difficult problems that would improve the state of the world. Problems that are messy, protracted, and involve the prospect of failure and embarrassment. They don\u2019t have a ready market. They affect rich and poor alike. They touch flawed systems. They\u2019re less \u201cWhat did Mom do to make my life better?\u201d and more \u201cWhat would make Mom proud?\u201d They require you to do more than cut a check, and\u00a0instead hunker down and grind away for years.What problems do I mean? Here are a few that come to mind that would give Silicon Valley the moral leadership to match its economic and intellectual might:WaterWe all know that California is stuck in a multi-year drought. It\u2019s the great equalizer. The Bay Area has been hit less hard by water rationing than Southern California, but the dry spell is finally\u00a0starting to impact people\u2019s ability to water their lawns and take out the Slip \u2018N Slide, not to mention its influence on the\u00a0epic wildfires that are destroying homes all over the state.Imagine if the resources of Silicon Valley were to tackle this challenge. How about building a water pipeline from Canada to northern California? Megascale desalination, Israeli-style? Large-scale conservation technologies? If there\u2019s something that would get everyone in California declaring companies as heroes it\u2019s this.\u00a0Water is free in California, but not really\u2014so be the water bringer.Traffic/infrastructureOne CEO commented that it took him about an hour to make a 15-mile commute in the morning to Palo Alto. I found myself shaking my head at the thought of all of these millionaires inching along in standstill traffic twice a day, even those that did their best to engineer a short commute. While some of their Teslas can drive themselves so the driver can send emails and whatnot, commute length is the single biggest determinant of day-to-day happiness according to psychologists. What use is being a mega-baller if you\u2019re stuck in traffic every day?I know, Google self-driving cars will go mainstream by 2030 and greatly reduce traffic (and potentially eliminate hundreds of thousands of driving jobs). In the meantime, how about dynamic tolling? Staggered commute times? Jetpacks? A public-private partnership to add four lanes to widen Route 101? Again, whoever did this would be a hero, and could probably name the new lanes after their\u00a0company.Diversity and social issuesAmerica is bifurcating fast. Social mobility is down, technological unemployment is rising, and we\u2019re heading toward a country where the non-white majority in 2043 will have lower levels of income, wealth, education, physical freedom, and political participation than the white minority. That\u2019s the country kids are growing into.Technology companies are starting to focus on getting more diversity in their own organizations, which is a great place to start. But there\u2019s much more that can be done.Take the current controversy over policing. You\u2019re telling me that the best non-lethal weapon we can give an officer in 2016 is a Taser with a range of 25 feet that was developed back in 1974? Or that I can have a video camera on my phone but we can\u2019t stick one on every badge?Is there really no better system than to rely on overworked guidance counselors and standardized testing at age 16 to identify talented minorities in inner cities?Technologists could do a lot to lead in the right direction.EducationNational SAT scores are at their lowest points in a decade. Online education is ubiquitous, yet we don\u2019t seem to be getting any smarter. If anything, it\u2019s kind of the opposite. We have decades of research on effective education that isn\u2019t being implemented nationwide. Meanwhile, we plow millions of kids through a factory system that was designed in the agrarian era.I love Altschool, Minerva Project, and the Khan Academy, but we\u2019re still just scratching the surface of both the opportunity and the need around the country. So many people want this, it\u2019s unreal.\u00a0There\u2019s even money in this one\u2014the US spends $621 billion on public education, with uneven results.Is filling out bubbles with a pencil on a test designed in 1901 still the best we can do to measure human potential?I\u2019m optimistic because this generation of techies is starting to have kids. Nothing motivates you to figure out what\u2019s going on with a system more than when your kid has to enter it\u00a0(even private schools).GovernmentWhen technologists interact with government, they tend to focus either on things that are good for their business interests (immigration, internet access) or libertarianism (stay out of the way).\u00a0Otherwise, money gets lost in a maze. It\u2019s a swamp, another world. The operating system of the government is out-of-date and needs an update\u2014only it\u2019s not capable of updating itself.Don\u2019t let the system scare you off. Look at Lawrence Lessig\u2014he\u2019s a law professor who\u2019s trying to get money out of politics and crowdfunded $11 million dollars to do it. That\u2019s how much Google spent on lobbying last year.Or Jen Pahlka and Code for America, which sends coders and designers to save cities money by showing them what a lean, talented team can do.Or Megan Smith who left Google to become CTO of the US, along with the wave of heroes who moved to Washington DC to save Healthcare.gov.It\u2019s still your country. Don\u2019t give up on it.Unsexy entrepreneurshipFor Silicon Valley denizens, this is the golden age of entrepreneurship. But if you look across the country, entrepreneurship is at a 24-year low and most young people are not starting businesses, online or otherwise. They\u2019re looking for jobs in Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Cleveland, St. Louis, Providence, Cincinnati, San Antonio, upstate New York, and wherever else to pay back loans and maybe start a family.Entrepreneurship in these other cities looks quite different than it does in the Valley. It\u2019s unsexy and gritty, measured in credit card debt\u00a0rather than VC meetings, by getting customers instead of visitors or users, by changing the neighborhood instead of changing the world. Companies are started not with a desire to be huge, but because there\u2019s a problem to be solved.These entrepreneurs look up to the people in the Valley for inspiration. You wouldn\u2019t believe how big a difference it would make to have tech rockstars spend time in these cities and commit to making them better. It would make these entrepreneurs think all things were possible.These are just problems that come to mind for me. The truth is that you could choose just about anything under the sun that you felt strongly about, as long as it came from a good place.When I ran a company, I didn\u2019t have time for much else. I thought that the work that I was doing represented\u00a0the most profound impact and good I could make\u00a0in the world. I was focused. I wanted to be rich. If someone asked me for help I would make a small contribution, but I felt my greatest contribution was my day job.After we got acquired, I thought about joining or starting another company. Instead I wound up founding a non-profit to make entrepreneurship more accessible and distributed throughout the US.That decision has driven the last five years. It\u2019s been a struggle and a massive education. The market\u2019s fuzzier. Nothing is as clean as you want it to be. The humanity of it can be overwhelming.But underlying the humanity is the conviction that the problem you\u2019re addressing is worth solving. It challenges you in ways similar to having a child\u2014you grow up or you quit, only quitting would make you a loser.Here\u2019s the plea to Silicon Valley: we\u2019re worried you\u2019re losing your soul. Please take on challenges that are worthy of you, that demand your heart, reputation, treasure, commitment, conviction, and values\u2014not just what the market\u2019s asking of you. You\u2019re the builders of this era. It\u2019s not enough. We need you to lead.",

This could be to create a video player instance, control playback or load a new source. A video API can also be used to monitor the state of a video player and receive notifications when certain playback events occur.Video player APIs may be slightly different across platforms to be more intuitive with the native environment. Bitmovin\u2019s video player API creates a unified experience across 4 APIs: Web/HTML5, Android, iOS and Roku.            \n        \n            \n            \n                Is the video player embeddable in HTML, supporting all popular formats?                \n            \n            \n                Embedding a video player in HTML can be done very easily by using a <script> element to insert the Javascript directly into the HTML tree and anchoring the player instance created to a simple <div> element in the HTML. Like below:<html lang=\"en\"><body><div id=\"player\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var player = new Player(document.getElementById('player'), conf);player.load(source);</script></body></html>Most modern video players support a wide range of popular video formats, including MP4, HLS, MPEG-DASH, Smooth and Progressive streams.

    "scraped_body": "\nWinFS (short for Windows Future Storage)[1] was the code name for a canceled[2] data storage and management system project based on relational databases, developed by Microsoft and first demonstrated in 2003. It was intended as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.\nWinFS includes a relational database for storage of information, and allows any type of information to be stored in it, provided there is a well defined schema for the type. Individual data items could then be related together by relationships, which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user. As the data has a well defined schema, any application can reuse the data; and using the relationships, related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved. Because the system knows the structure and intent of the information, it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them.\nWhile WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather, what WinFS enables applications to do is understand the structure of all data and extract the information that they can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish,[3] showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.\nWinFS was billed as one of the pillars of the \"Longhorn\" wave of technologies, and would ship as part of the next version of Windows.  It was subsequently decided that WinFS would ship after the release of Windows Vista, but those plans were shelved in June 2006,[4] with some of its component technologies being integrated into ADO.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.[5]\n\n\n\nMany filesystems found on common operating systems, including the NTFS filesystem which is used in modern versions of Microsoft Windows, store files and other objects only as a stream of bytes, and have little or no information about the data stored in the files.  Such file systems also provide only a single way of organizing the files, namely via directories and file names.[6][7]\nBecause a file system has no knowledge about the data it stores,[6] applications tend to use their own, often proprietary, file formats. This hampers sharing of data between multiple applications. It becomes difficult to create an application which processes information from multiple file types, because the programmers have to understand the structure and semantics of all the files.[8] Using common file formats is a workaround to this problem but not a universal solution; there is no guarantee that all applications will use the format. Data with standardized schema, such as XML documents and relational data fare better, as they have a standardized structure and run-time requirements.[9]\nAlso, a traditional file system can retrieve and search data based only on the filename, because the only knowledge it has about the data is the name of the files that store the data.[8]  A better solution is to tag files with attributes that describe them.  Attributes are metadata about the files such as the type of file (such as document, picture, music, creator, etc.).[6] This allows files to be searched for by their attributes, in ways not possible using a folder hierarchy, such as finding \"pictures which have person X\". The attributes can be recognizable by either the file system natively, or via some extension.[6] Desktop search applications take this concept a step further. They extract data, including attributes, from files and index it. To extract the data, they use a filter for each file format. This allows for searching based on both the file's attributes and the data in it.[6]\nHowever, this still does not help in managing related data, as disparate items do not have any relationships defined. For example, it is impossible to search for \"the phone numbers of all persons who live in Acapulco and each have more than 100 appearances in my photo collection and from whom I have had e-mail within the last month\". Such a search could not be done unless it is based on a data model which has both the semantics as well as relationships of data defined.[6][7]  WinFS aims to provide such a data model and the runtime infrastructure that can be used to store the data, as well as the relationships between data items according to the data model, doing so at a satisfactory level of performance.\n\n\nWinFS natively recognizes different types of data, such as  picture, e-mail, document, audio, video, calendar, contact, rather than just leaving them as raw unanalyzed bytestreams (as most file systems do). Data stored and managed by the system are instances of the data type recognized by the WinFS runtime. The data are structured by means of properties. For example, an instance of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 type will surface the data by exposing properties, such as Name, Educational Qualification, Experience. Each property may be a simple type (strings, integers, dates) or complex types (contacts).[8][10] Different data types expose different properties. Besides that, WinFS also allows different data instances to be related together; such as a document and a contact can be related by an Authored By relationship.[7][10] Relationships are also exposed as properties; for example if a document is related to a contact by a Created By relationship, then the document will have a Created By property. When it is accessed, the relationship is traversed and the related data returned.[10] By following the relations, all related data can be reached.[7] WinFS promotes sharing of data between applications by making the data types accessible to all applications, along with their schemas.[8] When an application wants to use a WinFS type, it can use the schema to find the data structure and can use the information. So, an application has access to all data on the system even though the developer did not have to write parsers to recognize the different data formats. It can also use relationships and related data to create dynamic filters to present the information the application deals with. The WinFS API further abstracts the task of accessing data. All WinFS types are exposed as .NET objects with the properties of the object directly mapping to the properties of the data type.[6] Also, by letting different applications that deal with the same data share the same WinFS data instance rather than storing the same data in different files, the hassles of synchronizing the different stores when the data change are removed.[11] Thus WinFS can reduce redundancies.[6][9]\nAccess to all the data in the system allows complex searches for data across all the data items managed by WinFS. In the example used above (\"the phone numbers of all persons who live in Acapulco and each have more than 100 appearances in my photo collection and with whom I have had e-mail within last month\"), WinFS can traverse the subject relationship of all the photos to find the contact items. Similarly, it can filter all emails in last month and access the communicated with relation to reach the contacts. The common contacts can then be figured out from the two sets of results and their phone number retrieved by accessing the suitable property of the contact items.\nIn addition to fully schematized data (like XML and relational data), WinFS supports semi-structured data (such as images, which have an unstructured bitstream plus structured metadata) as well as unstructured data (such as files) as well. It stores the unstructured components as files while storing the structured metadata in the structured store.[10] Internally, WinFS uses a relational database to manage data. It does not limit the data to belonging to any particular data model. The WinFS runtime maps the schema to a relational modality,[6] by defining the tables it will store the types in and the primary keys and foreign keys that would be required to represent the relationships. WinFS includes mappings for object and XML schemas by default. Mappings for other schemas must be specified. Object schemas are specified in XML; WinFS generates code to surface the schemas as .NET classes. ADO.NET can be used to directly specify the relational schema, though a mapping to the object schema must be provided to surface it as classes.[10] Relationship traversals are performed as joins on these tables. WinFS also automatically creates indexes on these tables, to enable fast access to the information.[10] Indexing speeds up joins significantly, and traversing relationships to retrieve related data is performed very fast. Indexes are also used during information search; searching and querying use the indexes to quickly complete the operations, much like desktop search systems.\n\n\nThis article's factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information.

None yet has resulted in a full featured runtime and API around it. Years are approximate.\nThe development of WinFS is an extension to a feature that was initially planned in the early 1990s. Dubbed Object File System, it was supposed to be included as part of Cairo. OFS was supposed to have powerful data aggregation features,[12] but the Cairo project was shelved, and with it OFS. However, later during the development of COM, a storage system, called Storage+, based on then-upcoming SQL Server 8.0, was planned, which was slated to offer similar aggregation features.[12] This, too, never materialized, and a similar technology, Relational File System (RFS), was conceived to be launched with SQL Server 2000.[12] However, SQL Server 2000 ended up being a minor upgrade to SQL Server 7.0 and RFS was not implemented.\nThe concept was not scrapped, and served as the base for WinFS.[12] WinFS was initially planned for inclusion in Windows Vista,[14] and build 4051 of Windows Vista, then called by its codename \"Longhorn\", given to developers at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in 2003, included WinFS, but it suffered from significant performance issues.[12] In August 2004, Microsoft announced that WinFS would not ship with Windows Vista; it would instead be available as a downloadable update after Vista's release.[12]\nOn August 29, 2005,[12] Microsoft quietly made Beta 1 of WinFS available to MSDN subscribers. It worked on Windows XP, and required the .NET Framework to run. The WinFS API was included in the System.Storage namespace.[15] The beta was refreshed on December 1, 2005 to be compatible with version 2.0 of the .NET Framework.[16] WinFS Beta 2 was planned for some time later in 2006,[17] and was supposed to include integration with Windows Desktop Search, so that search results include results from both regular files and WinFS stores, as well as allow access of WinFS data using ADO.NET.[18]\nOn June 23, 2006, the WinFS team at Microsoft announced that WinFS would no longer be delivered as a separate product,[4][19] and some components would be brought under the umbrella of other technologies. Many of the principle features Microsoft intended to provide with WinFS included a pane for metadata property editing, breadcrumb-based property navigation, filtering or stacking items over properties, incremental search, and saved searches;[20] these features were incorporated in Windows Vista.[21] Query composition, a feature of WinFS that allowed users to perform additional searches that reuse the results of a previous query,[22] was later incorporated in Windows Vista.[23]\nExamples of uses of the technology are the object-relational mapping components into ADO.NET Entity Framework; support for unstructured data, adminless mode of operation, support for file system objects via the FILESTREAM data type, and hierarchical data  in SQL Server 2008, then codenamed Katmai, as well as integration with Win32 APIs and Windows Shell and support for traversal of hierarchies by traversing relationships into later releases of Microsoft SQL Server;[5] and the synchronization components into Microsoft Sync Framework.[5]\nIn 2013 Bill Gates cited WinFS as his greatest disappointment at Microsoft and that the idea of WinFS was ahead of its time, which will re-emerge.[24]\n\n\n\nArchitecture of the WinFS Stack\nWinFS uses a relational engine, which derives from SQL Server 2005,[25] to provide the data-relations mechanism. WinFS stores are simply SQL Server database (.MDF) files with the FILESTREAM attribute set.[26] These files are stored in the access-restricted folder named \"System Volume Information\" (placed in the volume root),[27] in folders under the folder \"WinFS\" with names of GUIDs of these stores.[26]\nAt the bottom of the WinFS stack lies WinFS Core, which interacts with the filesystem and provides file-access and -addressing capabilities.[8] The relational engine leverages the WinFS core services to present a structured store and other services such as locking, which the WinFS runtime uses to implement the functionality. The WinFS runtime exposes services such as Synchronization and Rules that can be used to synchronize WinFS stores or perform certain actions on the occurrence of certain events.[8]\nWinFS runs as a service that runs three processes:[28]\n\nWinFS.exe, which hosts relational datastore\nWinFSSearch.exe, which hosts the indexing and querying engine\nWinFPM.exe (WinFS File Promotion Manager), which interfaces with the underlying file-system\nIt allows programmatic access to its features via a set of .NET Framework APIs. These enable applications to define custom-made data types, define relationships among data, store and retrieve information, and allow advanced searches.[6][8] The applications can then aggregate the data and present the aggregated data to the user.\n\n\nWinFS stores data in relational stores, which are exposed as virtual locations called stores.[12] A WinFS store is a common repository where any application can store data along with its metadata, relationships and schema. WinFS runtime can apply certain relationships itself; for example, if the values of the subject property of a picture and the name property of a contact are same, then WinFS can relate the contact with the picture.[29] Relations can also be specified by other applications or the user.[30]\nWinFS provides unified storage, but stops short of defining the format that is to be stored in the data stores. Instead it supports writing data in application-specific formats. But applications must provide a schema that defines how the file format should be interpreted.[6] For example, a schema could be added to allow WinFS to understand how to read and thus be able to search and analyze, (say) a PDF file. By using the schema, any application can read data from any other application, and this also allows different applications to write in each other's format by sharing the schema.[30]\nMultiple WinFS stores can be created on a single machine.[30] This allows different classes of data to be kept segregated; for example, official documents and personal documents can be kept in different stores. WinFS, by default, provides only one store, named \"DefaultStore\".[12] WinFS stores are exposed as shell objects, akin to Virtual folders, which dynamically generate a list of all items present in the store and present them in a folder view. The shell object also allows searching information in the datastore.[12]\nA data unit that has to be stored in a WinFS store is called a WinFS Item.[6][30] A WinFS item, along with the core data item, also contains information on how the data item is related to other data. This Relationship is stored in terms of logical links. Links specify which other data items the current item is related with. Put in other words, links specify the relationship of the data with other data items. Links are physically stored using a link identifier, which specifies the name and intent of the relationship, such as type of or consists of.[6] The link identifier is stored as an attribute of the data item. All the objects that have the same link ID are considered to be related.[6] An XML schema, defining the structure of the data items that will be stored in WinFS, must be supplied to the WinFS runtime beforehand.[6] In Beta 1 of WinFS, the schema assembly had to be added to the GAC before it could be used.\n\n\nWinFS models data using the data items, along with their relationships, extensions and rules governing its usage.[8] WinFS needs to understand the type and structure of the data items, so that the information stored in the data item can be made available to any application that requests it. This is done by the use of schemas. For every type of data item that is to be stored in WinFS, a corresponding schema needs to be provided to define the type, structure and associations of the data. These schemas are defined using XML.[6]\nPredefined WinFS schemas include schemas for documents, e-mail, appointments, tasks, media, audio, video, and also includes system schemas that include configuration, programs, and other system-related data.[8] Custom schemas can be defined on a per-application basis, in situations where an application wants to store its data in WinFS, but not share the structure of that data with other applications, or they can be made available across the system.[8]\n\n\nWinFS Type Hierarchy\nThe most important difference between a file system and WinFS is that WinFS knows the type of each data item that it stores. And the type specifies the properties of the data item. The WinFS type system is closely associated with the .NET framework's concept of classes and inheritance. A new type can be created by extending and nesting any predefined types.[6]\nWinFS provides four predefined base types \u2013 Items, Relationships, ScalarTypes and NestedTypes.[6] An Item is the fundamental data object which can be stored, and a Relationship is the relation or link between two data items. Since all WinFS items must have a type, the type of item stored defines its properties. The properties of an Item may be a ScalarType, which defines the smallest unit of information a property can have, or a NestedType, which is a collection of more than one ScalarTypes and/or NestedTypes. All WinFS types are made available as .NET CLR classes.[30]\nAny object represented as a data unit, such as contact, image, video, document etc., can be stored in a WinFS store as a specialization of the Item type.[30] By default, WinFS provides Item types for Files, Contact, Documents, Pictures, Audio, Video, Calendar, and Messages. The File Item can store any generic data, which is stored in file systems as files. But unless an advanced schema is provided for the file, by defining it to be a specialized Item, WinFS will not be able to access its data. Such a file Item can only support being related to other Items.[6]\n\nDefining a new Type\nA developer can extend any of these types, or the base type Item, to provide a type for their custom data. The data contained in an Item is defined in terms of properties, or fields that hold the actual data. For example, an Item Contact may have a field Name that is a ScalarType, and one field Address, a NestedType, which is further composed of two ScalarTypes. To define this type, the base class Item is extended and the necessary fields are added to the class.[6] A NestedType field can be defined as another class that contains the two ScalarType fields. Once the type is defined, a schema has to be defined, which denotes the primitive type of each field, for example, the Name field is a String, the Address field is a custom defined Address class, both the fields of which are Strings. Other primitive types that WinFS supports are Integer, Byte, Decimal, Float, Double, Boolean and DateTime, among others.[6] The schema will also define which fields are mandatory and which are optional.[31] The Contact Item defined in this way will be used to store information regarding the Contact, by populating the properties field and storing it. Only those fields marked as mandatory needs to be filled up during initial save.[30] Other fields may be populated later by the user, or not populated at all. If more properties fields, such as last conversed date, need to be added, this type can be extended to accommodate them. Item types for other data can be defined similarly.\n\nRelationships\nWinFS creates tables for all defined Items.[31] All the fields defined for the Item form the columns of the table and all instances of the Item are stored as rows in the table for the respective Items. Whenever some field in the table refers to data in some other table, it is considered a relationship. The schema of the relationship specifies which tables are involved and what the kind and name of the relationship is. The WinFS runtime manages the relationship schemas.[30] All Items are exposed as .NET CLR objects, with a uniform interface providing access to the data stored in the fields. Thus any application can retrieve object of any Item type and can use the data in the object, without being aware of the physical structure the data was stored in.[6]\nWinFS types are exposed as .NET classes, which can be instantiated as .NET objects. Data are stored in these type instances by setting their properties. Once done, they are persisted into the WinFS store. A WinFS store is accessed using an ItemContext class (see Data retrieval section for details). ItemContext allows transactional access to the WinFS store; i.e. all the operations since binding an ItemContext object to a store till it is closed either all succeed or are all rolled back. As changes are made to the data, they are not written to the disc; rather they are written to an in-memory log. Only when the connection is closed are the changes written to the disc in a batch. This helps to optimize disc I/O.[10] The following code snippet, written in C#, creates a contact and stores it in a WinFS store.\n\n //Connect to the default WinFS store\n using(ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open())\n {\n     //Create the contact and set the data in appropriate properties\n     ContactEAddress contact = new ContactEAddress() {\n         Name = new PersonName() {                      // Name is a ComplexType\n             Displayname = \"Doe, John\",\n             FirstName = \"John\",\n             LastName = \"Doe\"\n         },\n         TelephoneNumber = new TelephoneNumber() {     // Telephone number is a ComplexType\n             Country = CountryCode.Antarctica,\n             Areacode = 4567,\n             Number = 9876543210\n         },\n         Age = 111                                     // Age is a SimpleType\n    };\n\n    //Add the object to the user's personal folder.\n    //This relates the item with the Folder pseudo-type, for backward\n    //compatibility, as this lets the item to be accessed in a folder \n    //hierarchy for apps which are not WinFS native.\n    Folder containingFolder = UserDataFolder.FindMyPersonalFolder();\n    containingFolder.OutFolderMemberRelationship.AddItem(ic, contact);\n\n    //Find a document and relate with the document. Searching begins by creating an\n    //ItemSearcher object. Each WinFS type object contains a GetSearcher() method\n    //that generates an ItemSearcher object which searches documents of that type.\n    using (ItemSearcher searcher = Document.GetSearcher(ic))\n    {\n         Document d = searcher.Find(@\"Title = 'Some Particular Document'\");\n         d.OutAuthoringRelationship.AddItem(ic, contact);\n    }\n    //Since only one document is to be found, the ItemContext.FindOne() method\n    //could be used as well.\n\n    //Find a picture and relate with it\n    using (ItemSearcher searcher = Picture.GetSearcher(ic))\n    {\n         Picture p = searcher.Find(@\"Occasion = 'Graduation' and Sequence = '3'\");\n         p.OutSubjectRelationship.AddItem(ic, contact);\n    }\n\n    //Persist to the store and close the reference to the store\n    ic.Update();\n }\n\n\nA datum can be related to one more item, giving rise to a one-to-one relationship, or with more than one items, resulting in a one-to-many relationship.[6] The related items, in turn, may be related to other data items as well, resulting in a network of relationships, which is called a many-to-many relationship. Creating a relationship between two Items creates another field in the data of the Items concerned which refer the row in the other Item's table where the related object is stored.[30]\n\nWinFS Relationships\nIn WinFS, a Relationship is an instance of the base type Relationship, which is extended to signify a specialization of a relation. A Relationship is a mapping between two items, a Source and a Target. The source has an Outgoing Relationship, whereas the target gets an Incoming Relationship.[31] WinFS provides three types of primitive relationships \u2013 Holding Relationship, Reference Relationship and Embedding Relationship.[6] Any custom relationship between two data types are instances of these relationship types.\n\nHolding Relationships specify ownership and lifetime (which defines how long the relationship is valid) of the Target Item. For example, the Relationship between a folder and a file, and between an Employee and his Salary record, is a Holding Relationship \u2013 the latter is to be removed when the former is removed. A Target Item can be a part of more than one Holding Relationships. In such a case, it is to be removed when all the Source Items are removed.\nReference Relationships provide linkage between two Items, but do not have any lifetime associated, i.e., each Item will continue to be stored even without the other.\nEmbedding Relationships give order to the two Items that are linked by the Relationship, such as the Relationship between a Parent Item and a Child Item.\nRelationships between two Items can either be set programmatically by the application creating the data, or the user can use the WinFS Item Browser to manually relate the Items.[31] A WinFS item browser can also graphically display the items and how they are related, to enable the user to know how their data are organized.[30]\n\n\nWinFS includes Rules,[22] which are executed when a certain condition is met. WinFS rules work on data and data relationships. For example, a rule can be created that states that whenever an Item is created which contains field \"Name\" and if the value of that field is some particular name, a relationship should be created that relates the Item with some other Item. WinFS rules can also access any external application. For example, a rule can be built which launches a Notify application whenever a mail is received from a particular contact.[22] WinFS rules can also be used to add new properties fields to existing data Items.[22]\nWinFS rules are also exposed as .NET CLR objects. As such any rule can be used for any purpose. A rule can even be extended by inheriting from it to form a new rule that consists of the condition and action of the parent rule plus something more.[22]\n\n\nWinFS supports creating Rich Application Views (RAV) by aggregating different data in a virtual table format. Unlike database view, where each individual element can only be a scalar value, RAVs can have complex Items or even collections of Items. The actual data can be across multiple data types or instances and can even be retrieved by traversing relationships.[10] RAVs are intrinsically paged (dividing the entire set of data into smaller pages containing disconnected subsets of the data) by the WinFS runtime. The page size is defined during creation of the view and the WinFS API exposes methods to iterate over the pages. RAVs also supports modification of the view according to different grouping parameters. Views can also be queried against.\n\n\nEven though all data are shared, everything is not equally accessible. WinFS uses the Windows authentication system to provide two data protection mechanisms.[30] First, there is share-level security that controls access to your WinFS share. Second, there is item level security that supports NT compatible security descriptors. The process accessing the item must have enough privileges to access it. Also in Vista there is the concept of \"integrity level\" for an application. Higher integrity data cannot be accessed by a lower integrity process.\n\n\nFlowchart for creating, searching and updating WinFS data instances\nThe primary mode of data retrieval from a WinFS store is querying the WinFS store according to some criteria,[8] which returns an enumerable set of items matching the criteria. The criteria for the query is specified using the OPath query language. The returned data are made available as instances of the type schemas, conforming to the .NET object model.[32] The data in them can be accessed by accessing the properties of individual objects.[31]\nRelations are also exposed as properties. Each WinFS Item has two properties, named IncomingRelationships and OutgoingRelationships, which provide access to the set of relationship instances the item participates in. The other item which participates in one relationship instance can be reached through the proper relationship instance.[10][31]\nThe fact that the data can be accessed using its description, rather than location, can be used to provide end-user organizational capabilities without limiting to the hierarchical organization as used in file-systems. In a file system, each file or folder is contained in only one folder. But WinFS Items can participate in any number of holding relationships, that too with any other items. As such, end users are not limited to only file/folder organization. Rather, a contact can become a container for documents; a picture a container for contacts and so on. For legacy compatibility, WinFS includes a pseudo-type called Folder, which is present only to participate in holding relationships and emulate file/folder organization. Since any WinFS Item can be related with more than one Folder item, from an end user perspective, an item can reside in multiple folders without duplicating the actual data.[10] Applications can also analyze the relationship graphs to present various filters. For example, an email application can analyze the related contacts and the relationships of the contacts with restaurant bills and dynamically generate filters like \"Emails sent to people I had lunch with\".\n\n\nThe WinFS API provides a class called the ItemContext class, which is bound to a WinFS store. The ItemContext object can be used to scope the search to the entire store or a subset of it. It also provides transactional access to the store.[15] An object of this class can then spawn an ItemSearcher object which then takes the type (an object representing the type) of the item to be retrieved or the relationship and the OPath query string representing the criteria for the search.[31][33] A set of all matches is returned, which can then be bound to a UI widget for displaying en masse or enumerating individually.[30] The properties items can also be modified and then stored back to the data store to update the data. The ItemContext object is closed (which marks the end of association of the object with the store) when the queries are made or changes merged into the store.\nRelated items can also be accessed through the items. The IncomingRelationships and OutgoingRelationships properties give access to all the set of relationship instances, typed to the name of the relationship. These relationship objects expose the other item via a property. So, for example, if a picture is related to a picture, it can be accessed by traversing the relationship as:\n\nContactsCollection contacts = picture.OutgoingRelationships.Cast(typeof(Contact)).Value;\n// This retrieves the collection of all outgoing relationships from a picture object\n// and filters down the contacts reachable from them and retrieves its value.\n\n// Or the relationship can be statically specified as\nContactsCollection contacts = picture.OutgoingRelationships.OutContactRelationship.Contact;\n\n\nAn OPath query string allows to express the parameters that will be queried for to be specified using Item properties, embedded Items as well as Relationships.[citation needed] It can specify a single search condition, such as \"title = Something'\", or a compound condition such as \"title = 'Title 1' || title = 'Title 2' && author = 'Someone'\". These Boolean and relational operations can be specified using C# like &&, ||, =, != operators as well as their English-like equivalent like EQUAL, NOT EQUAL. SQL like operators such as LIKE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY are also supported, as are wildcard conditions.[citation needed] So, \"title LIKE 'any*'\" is a valid query string. These operators can be used to execute complex searches such as \n\nusing (ItemContext ic = ItemContext.Open())\n{\n    // Searching begins by creating a ItemSearcher object. The searcher is created from a\n    // relationship instance because the contacts being searched for are in relation. The\n    // first parameter defines the scope of the search. An ItemContext as the scope means\n    // the entire store is to be searched. Scope can be limited to a set of Items which may\n    // be in a holding relationship with the contacts. In that case, the set is passed as\n    // the scope of the search.\n    ItemSearcher searcher = OutContactRelationship.GetTargetSearcher(ic, typeof(Contact));\n    ContactCollection contacts = searcher.FindAll(\"OutContactRelationship.Contact.Name LIKE 'A*'\");\n}\n\nThe above code snippet creates an ItemSearcher object that searches on the OutContactRelationship instance that relates pictures and contacts, in effect searching all pictures related with a contact. It then runs the query Name LIKE 'A*'\" on all contacts reachable through OutContactRelationship, returning the list of \"contacts whose names start with A and whose pictures I have\". Similarly, more relationships could be taken into account to further narrow down the results.[10][31] Further, a natural language query processor, which parses query in natural language and creates a well-formed OPath query string to search via proper relationships, can allow users to make searches such as \"find the name of the wine I had with person X last month\", provided financial management applications are using WinFS to store bills.\nDifferent relations specify a different set of data. So when a search is made that encompasses multiple relations, the different sets of data are retrieved individually and a union of the different sets is computed. The resulting set contains only those data items that correspond to all the relations.[31]\n\n\nWinFS includes better support for handling data that changes frequently. Using WinFS Notifications, applications choose to be notified of changes to selected data Items. WinFS will raise an ItemChangedEvent, using the .NET Event model, when a subscribed-to Item changes, and the event will be published to the applications.[31]\n\n\nWinFS includes an Information Agent feature for the management, retrieval, and storage of end-user notification rules and preferences for changes to items in the data store. Using Information Agent, it is possible to automatically define relations to new items based on events such as appointments, with an example being that appointments can be related to photos based on the dates the photos were taken, enabling queries for birthdays or holidays without needing to know the actual dates of such events (\"find all photos taken on this birthday\"). Other examples include automatically moving new items to specific folders based on a rule as determined by appointment times and dates the photos were taken (\"when I import a photo taken during a business event, move it to the Business Events folder\") or more complex possibilities. Information Agent can also forward notifications to other devices (\"if I receive a high priority email from my boss, send a notification to my phone\") and is similar to Rules and Alerts functionality of Microsoft Outlook.\n\n\nWinFS allows easy sharing of data between applications, and among multiple WinFS stores, which may reside on different computers, by copying to and from them.[34] A WinFS item can also be copied to a non-WinFS file system, but unless that data item is put back into the WinFS store, it will not support the advanced services provided by WinFS.\nThe WinFS API also provides some support for sharing with non-WinFS applications. WinFS exposes a shell object to access WinFS stores. This object maps WinFS items to a virtual folder hierarchy, and can be accessed by any application.[12] Virtual folders can automatically share new content referenced by the query with users (a virtual folder for \"all vacation photos\" can automatically share new items returned by this query with users). WinFS data can also be manually shared using network shares, by sharing the legacy shell object.[34] Non-WinFS file formats can be stored in WinFS stores, using the File Item, provided by WinFS. Importers can be written, to convert specific file formats to WinFS Item types.[34]\nIn addition, WinFS provides services to automatically synchronize items in two or more WinFS stores, subject to some predefined condition, such as \"share only photos\" or \"share photos that have an associated contact X\".[34] The stores may be on different computers. Synchronization is done in a peer-to-peer fashion; there is no central authority. A synchronization can be either manual or automatic or scheduled. During synchronization, WinFS finds the new and modified Items, and updates accordingly. If two or more changes conflict, WinFS can either resort to automatic resolution based on predefined rules, or defer the synchronization for manual resolution. WinFS also updates the schemas, if required.[34]\n\nApplication support[edit]\n\nWinFS Beta 1 includes a shell namespace extension, which surfaces WinFS stores as top level objects in My Computer view.[12] Files can be copied into and out of the stores, as well as applications can be directly used to save there. Even folders such as My Documents can be redirected to the stores.[12] WinFS uses Importer plug-ins to analyze the files as they were being imported to the store and create proper WinFS schemas and objects, and when taking the objects out, re-pack them into files.[34] If importers for certain files are not installed, they are stored as generic File types.\n\n\nMicrosoft Rave is an application that shipped with WinFS Beta 1. It allows synchronization of two or more WinFS stores, and supports synchronization in full mesh mode as well as the central hub topology. While synchronizing, Microsoft Rave will determine the changes made to each store since the last sync, and update accordingly. When applying the changes, it also detects if there is any conflict, i.e., the same data has been changed on both stores since the last synchronization. It will either log the conflicting data for later resolution or have it resolved immediately.  Microsoft Rave uses peer-to-peer technology to communicate and transfer data.\n\n\nWinFS included StoreSpy, a WinFS Item browser that could be used to browse structured data instances with their properties and relationships.\nWith WinFS Beta 1, Microsoft included an unsupported application called StoreSpy,[35] which allowed one to browse WinFS stores by presenting a hierarchical view of WinFS Items. It automatically generated virtual folders based on access permissions, date and other metadata, and presented them in a hierarchical tree view, akin to what traditional folders are presented in. The application generated tabs for different Item types. StoreSpy allowed viewing Items, Relationships, MultiSet, Nested Elements, Extensions[36] and other types in the store along with its full metadata. It also presented a search interface to perform manual searches, and save them as virtual folders. The application also presented a graphical view of WinFS Rules. However, it did not allow editing of Items or their properties, though it was slated for inclusion in a future release.[37] But the WinFS project was cut back before it could materialize.\n\n\nWinFS also includes another application, named WinFS Type Browser, which can be used to browse the WinFS types, as well as visualize the hierarchical relationship between WinFS types.[38] A WinFS type, both built-in types as well as custom schemas, can be visualized along with all the properties and methods that it supports. It also shows the types that it derives from as well as other types that extend the type schema. However, while it was included with WinFS, it was released as an unsupported tool.[38]\n\n\nWinFS Beta 1 also includes an unsupported application, named OPather.[39] It presents a graphical interface for writing Opath queries. It can be used by selecting target object type and specifying the parameters of the query. It also includes Intellisense-like parameter completion feature. It can then be used to perform visualization tasks like binding results of a query to a DataGrid control, create views of the data in WinFS itself, or just extract the query string.\n\n\nMicrosoft launched a project to build a data visualization application for WinFS. It was codenamed \"Project Orange\" and was supposedly built using Windows Presentation Foundation.[40] It was supposed to provide exploration of Items stored in WinFS stores, and data relationships were supposed to be a prominent part of the navigation model. It was supposed to let people allow organization of the WinFS stores graphically as well\u00a0\u2013 productizing many of the concepts shown in the IWish Concept Video WMV File. However, since the WinFS project went dark, the status of this project is unknown.\n\n\nDesktop organizer\nGNOME Storage \u2013 a storage management system for the GNOME desktop\nNEPOMUK\nReFS\nRelational database management system (RDBMS)\n\n\n\n^ \"Leaked Windows hints at changes to come\".

    "scraped_body": "For Ruby you have rvm, rbenv, ry and a dozen other version managers.\nFor Elixir you have kiex and exenv.\nFor Erlang you have evm, erln8 and kerl.\nFor Node.js you have nvm and nvmw.\n\nYou get the idea. There are version managers for almost every language out there. Each of these languages have specific environmental requirements that must be met, each one slightly different from the others. But there are a lot of similarities between these tools. Most of them alter your PATH environment variable based on which version you have selected. They might also set a few other custom environment variables needed for the language to function properly. Some are more invasive and replace shell commands, like cd, with their own versions that handle version switching. But at the core, all of them alter your shell environment so that different executables are used based on the version you select. This is a common characteristic of all these version managers.\n\nUsing all these version managers also adds a lot of overhead as each is working to customize your environment. You have to ensure you have the version manager installed and configured correctly. You also have to ensure that the version managers don\u2019t interfere with each other. Since they are all altering the shell environment there is a good chance they will affect each other in some way.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution to all this? Are we stuck juggling different version managers for everything? I did a lot of searching and asked a lot of questions online and found nearly a dozen open source projects out there aimed at solving this problem. But in this post I want to focus on one that I found to be particularly good at solving this issue - asdf.\n\nNote that I was looking for a tool to help manage software versions in my development environment on my laptop. I don\u2019t normally run different versions of the same VM or interpreter on production servers. Only in development do I have a need to for multiple language versions to be installed. As a result, all my thoughts in this post are about asdf in development, not production.\n\nWhat is asdf?\n\nExtendable version manager with support for Ruby, Node.js, Elixir, Erlang & more\n\n\nasdf is an extendable version manager with support for Ruby, Node.js, Elixir and Erlang (and now Lua). It was created by Akash Manohar (@HashNuke) and was designed to replace all the language-specific version managers. It\u2019s also 100% shell script, which makes it easy to install and relatively portable. asdf doesn\u2019t include support for any language directly. Each language is supported via a plugin that contains all the language specific version management details. asdf\u2019s plugin system makes it easy to install, upgrade and remove plugins as needed. The plugin system also makes it easy to add support for new languages by third parties. asdf plugins are just plain old git repositories with a few shell scripts in them. Installation of a plugin can be done with the asdf plugin-add command.\n\nInstallation of different language versions is very easy as well. Versions can be set globally or on a per-directory basis with a .tool-versions file, which can define the language versions to be used for a directory. If you were working on a Ruby and Elixir project, you would normally set the Ruby version in one place (e.g. the .ruby-version file) and the Elixir version in another (e.g. the .exenv-version file). With asdf you create a .tool-versions file and define all the language version requirements for the project in it.\n\nGeneric Version Managers Like This Already Exist, What Makes asdf Different?\n\nasdf has several advantages over the other version managers available:\n\n\nSimplicity - asdf is by far the most simple and easy to install\nComplete set of version management features - asdf has simple commands to install, list, and remove software versions. Commands are also integrated with the .tool-versions file. There are also commands for adding, upgrading and removing plugins.\nSimple method of setting defaults - All defaults can be set by creating a .tool-versions file in your home directory. If a subdirectory you are in doesn\u2019t contain a .tool-versions file asdf crawls up the directory tree looking for one. If it gets to your home directory without finding one it uses the defaults you have set there.\nExtendable - Plugins are easy to install and write and can be designed to do almost anything you want.\n\n\n\nBelow I list a few of the more popular projects along with some of the issues I see with them and some of the features asdf has that they lack. These are good projects with a lot of great people behind them. This comparison isn\u2019t to bash the alternatives, but rather to compare their differences. Most of these projects offer more flexibility than asdf in some areas, and as a result often lack some of the features present in asdf.\n\n\nAutoenv - https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv\n\n\nWritten in Bash and Python\noverrides the cd command.\nLacks plugins and installation commands. You have to write bash files on a per-directory basis.\n\n\nAutoenv for Zsh - https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-autoenv\n\n\nWritten in Zsh and Perl\nLacks plugins and installation commands. You have to write bash files on a per-directory basis. Only works in Zsh.\n\n\nsmartcd - https://github.com/cxreg/smartcd\n\n\nWritten in Perl and Bash\noverrides the cd command.\nLacks plugins and installation commands. You have to write bash files on a per-directory basis.\n\n\ndirenv - https://github.com/direnv/direnv\n\n\nWritten in Go and Bash\nCustomizes environment on a per-directory basis with a .envrc file\nLacks plugins and installation commands. You have to write bash files on a per-directory basis (.envrc).\n\n\nEnvironment Modules - http://modules.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nWritten in C\nCustomizes environment on a per-directory basis\nLacks plugins and installation commands.\n\n\nNix - https://nixos.org/nix/\n\n\nWritten in Perl and C++\nCustomizes environment on a per-shell basis\nYou have to create Nix profiles for each different project environment you need. Profiles need to be created using nix commands.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile features of many of these tools are similar to asdf, none match the simplicity and easy of use of asdf. asdf is 100% shell script, whereas the alternatives are partially implemented in other languages like Python, Go and C. The addition of another language often makes installation more difficult and usually adds several more dependencies to the tool. Many of these tools also require you to write shell scripts to setup the environment for each project which is something I find very tiresome when setting up small projects.\n\nBut asdf Doesn\u2019t Support the Language I Use!\n\nThere is a plugin API that is extremely simple and very well documented (I can attest to this since I developed the Lua plugin for asdf). Development of a plugin for a new language or framework is straightforward and can be done in a couple of hours.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nasdf uses shims to ensure the right executable is run. Shims are stored in a directory that is part of your PATH. When you execute a shim that shim figures out your current directory and looks for a .tool-versions file in it. If one exists it reads the version information and determines which one of the real executables should be executed. For example, suppose you have ruby 2.2.4 and ruby 1.9.3 installed. Each install includes an irb executable but neither are on your PATH. If you are in a project that uses Ruby 2.2.4 (because it\u2019s defined in your .tool-versions file), the irb executable in the 2.2.4 install is the executable that should be run. The shim will see that your in a project that requires Ruby 2.2.4 and look for the irb executable in that Ruby install and execute it. If for some reason you didn\u2019t have Ruby 2.2.4 installed the executable wouldn\u2019t be found (since that Ruby installation doesn\u2019t exist on your machine) and ruby 2.2.4 not installed will be printed by the shim. Since this only happens when you run an executable the asdf overhead is kept to a minimum. Of course there are many more details in the source code that I won\u2019t bother to mention here.\n\nHow Do I Use It?\n\nInstallation\n\nInstallation is simple:\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf.git ~/.asdf\n\n# For Ubuntu or other linux distros\n$ echo '. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n# OR for Max OSX\n$ echo '. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nThen install the dependencies:\n\n\nOn OSX install automake autoconf openssl libyaml readline libxslt libtool unixodbc with homebrew.\nOn Ubuntu install automake autoconf libreadline-dev libncurses-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libxslt-dev libffi-dev libtool unixodbc-dev with apt-get.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it! You should be able to view asdf help by running asdf in the shell.\n\nUsage\n\nSay we want to install ruby 2.2.4 for a project we are going to build. First we have to install the ruby plugin (you will only need to do this once):\n\n$ asdf plugin-add ruby https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf-ruby.git\n\n\nNow we can install ruby 2.2.4:\n\n$ asdf install ruby 2.2.4\n\n\nNext we just cd into our project directory and create a .tool-versions file inside it containing the ruby version:\n\n$ echo 'ruby 2.2.4' >> .tool-versions\n\n\nThat\u2019s it! Now we can use all the executables that came with the Ruby 2.2.4 install in our project.\n\nSummary\n\nI have been using asdf exclusively at work and at home for almost 4 months now. I have been able to uninstall a lot of software and simplify my dotfiles a lot since switching to asdf. Overall it has provided a big a boost to my productivity. Now I don\u2019t even think about version management most of the time. With the few Erlang version managers available I was always struggling to come up with a good strategy for Erlang version management. With asdf, Erlang version management just works. I hope you will take a look at the project and give it a try. You won\u2019t regret trying it.\n\nResources\n\n\nasdf: https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf\nasdf-lua: https://github.com/Stratus3D/asdf-lua\nhttp://cazrin.net/blog/2016/my-favourite-version-management-tool/\n\n\n",

Review Signal had been collecting data for months\u00a0and early ratings data was\u00a0starting to become meaningful. A tiny company was at the top of the rankings. A Small Orange.\nThe most worrisome part of this revelation was that A Small Orange did not have an affiliate program. Which isn't a requirement at all for a listing on Review Signal.\nHowever, after investing years of work, if the top rated company ended up not having an affiliate program, the business was likely sunk before it even started. So I inquired early and heard back from the CEO at the time, \u201cwe don't have an affiliate program and at the moment, we have no plans for one.\u201d\u00a0This was a potential death knell because the entire business model relies on making at least some money, even though I assumed it would be much lower than my competitors who simply sell their rankings to the highest bidder. But as any entrepreneur knows, almost everything is negotiable if you understand what the other person really wants and why. After talking further with the CEO, he explained his issue with web hosting review websites, \u201cthey typically have a pay for ranking sort of model and do it either through set rates or affiliate payouts. It varies. The economics at ASO don't really work out for a standard affiliate program.\u201d A Small Orange didn't want to play the game that every other review site out there did. Pay to play, quality be damned.\nThis CEO hated the games being played as much as I did.\nThat was all the opportunity I needed. Review Signal's mission has been to fight against that very same model and I knew I had an early ally who\u00a0could make this work. We ended up working out a deal to pay three months of whatever plan someone purchased and he put a cap on my potential earnings at $250 before he would review the performance. Considering the most popular plans were $25/year and $5/month, this wasn't going to earn a lot, but at least it might start covering some of the very basic costs. The first month I earned $52.38 on 6 sales for an average of $8.73 per sale with A Small Orange.\nAt least it was something. And a foot in the door was all I needed to prove this crazy idea called Review Signal might have some legs. A Small Orange opened that door and for that our histories\u00a0will forever be intertwined.\nThe Good Times\nThe next few years were very good. I was their first affiliate. I was their biggest affiliate for many years, bringing in over a thousand new customers. I got to know many of the staff and would consider some of them friends. And A Small Orange continued to be the best rated shared hosting company through 2014. Everyone was happy - their customers, the company and Review Signal. I was happy to recommend them based on the data showing they had incredibly satisfied customers. I had people tell me personally they were very happy with them after signing up because of the data I publish here at Review Signal.\nFree Swag and Annual Thank You Card from ASO\nThe EIG Acquisition\nA Small Orange was quietly acquired in 2012. They were acquired by a behemoth in the hosting industry called Endurance International Group (NASDAQ: EIGI) which owns dozens of brands including some of the largest and most well known hosting companies: Blue Host, Host Gator, Host Monster, Just Host, Site5, iPage, Arvixe and more.\nEIG has a very bad reputation in the web hosting world. If you ask most industry veterans they will tell you to run to the hills when it comes to EIG. The oft-repeated story is EIG acquires a hosting company, migrates them to their platform and the quality of service falls off a cliff. The best example of this is perhaps their migration to their Provo, UT data-center which had a catastrophic outage in 2013. This outage was huge. The impact dropped four of EIG's largest brands many percentage points in the Review Signal rankings in a single day. \u00a0But these major outages continue to happen as recently as November 2015.\nIn a recent earnings call with share holders, EIG CEO Hari Ravichandran talked about two recent acquisitions and their plans for them. \u201cWe expect to manage these businesses at breakeven to marginally profitable for the rest of the year as we migrate their subscriber bases onto our back-end platform. Once on platform, we expect to reach favorable economics and adjusted EBITDA contribution consistent with our previous framework for realizing synergies from acquisitions.\u201d\nThe EIG Playbook\nEIG's playbook has been to acquire web hosting brands, migrate them to their platform and 'reach favorable economics.' They've been doing it for years and it seems to be working well enough for investors to continue to put money into the company. M&A to grow subscriber bases and economies of scale to lower costs. It's a very simple and straightforward business plan. It doesn't speak to anything beyond spreadsheet math though, such as brand value and customer loyalty. And those are certainly lowered and lost post-EIG acquisition according to all the data we've collected over years and multiple acquired brands. It's calloused business accounting, but it makes perfect sense in the race to the bottom industry that is commodity shared hosting.\nReview Signal Rating Calculated Pos/(Pos+Neg), without duplicate filtering\nYou can see all the EIG brands tracked here on Review Signal in the chart above and their acquisition dates below:\niPage - 2009.\u00a0BlueHost/HostMonster - 2010.\u00a0JustHost - Feb 2011.\u00a0NetFirms - March 2011.\u00a0HostGator - June 2012.\u00a0A Small Orange \u00a0- July 2012.\u00a0Arvixe - November 2014.\u00a0Site5 - August 2015.\nYou'll notice their ratings, in general, are not very good with Site5 (their most recent acquisition) being the exception. iPage was acquired before I started tracking data. BlueHost/HostMonster also had a decline, although the data doesn't start pre-acquisition. JustHost collapses post acquisition. NetFirms has remained consistently mediocre. HostGator collapses with a major outage a year after acquisition. Arvixe collapses a year after being acquired. Site5 is still very recent and hasn't shown any signs of decline yet.\nThe Expected Decline of A Small Orange\nSo nearly every industry veteran I talked to expected A Small Orange to collapse. Immediately after acquisition. Except me. I was, am and will continue to be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to a company until I am shown evidence.\nFor years, post acquisition people were saying ASO's demise was right around the corner. For years, I still waited for that evidence and the prophecy to become true. But it didn't happen.\nIt often took EIG less than a year to ruin a brand. We don't have to look further than Arvixe for an example of this, which was acquired in November 2014. Today, Arvixe has one of the lowest ratings of any company on Review Signal at a shockingly low 27%.\nBut A Small Orange continued to chug along. It didn't hear the naysayers or believe itself to be a victim of the EIG curse. Instead, ASO was the best shared host for years post-acquisition. It seemed to have a fair level of autonomy from the EIG conglomerate. The staff I knew there, remained there, and all indications showed they were still the same company.\nUntil it wasn't.\nThe Fall of A Small Orange\nA Small Orange Historical Rating\nThe chart above shows Review Signal's rating of A Small Orange. The Blue line is the rating as calculated by [Positive Reviews / (Positive Reviews + Negative Reviews)]. The Red line only calculates the rating from the past 12 months of data. It's slightly different than Review Signal's actual calculation because I am not filtering out duplicates for quick analysis. The difference for A Small Orange is that when you remove the duplicates, the year 2015 had a 43% rating indicating there was quite a few people writing multiple negative things about A Small Orange.\nSometime in 2015, the A Small Orange that thousands of people trusted and raved about became another EIG brand. I tried to get the inside story. I reached out to the former CEO who sold the company to EIG and became an executive there for a couple years post acquisition. He reached out on my behalf to EIG's PR team to see if they would participate in this story. Both declined to participate.\nSo, I'm left to speculate on what happened at A Small Orange based on what's been publicly stated by their CEO and watching their strategy unfold for years across many companies/brands. My best guess is EIG finally got involved with A Small Orange. They used to be a distributed/remote team, now all positions they are hiring for are listed as in Texas (their headquarters). I saw a HostGator representative get moved over to ASO's team, so the internal staff was changing and people were being moved from brands with less than stellar reputations to ASO. The former CEO left mid-2014, which likely left a leadership and responsibility gap. ASO could probably run on auto pilot through the end of 2014, but over time having no champion for your brand in upper management eventually will come back to hurt the brand when decisions get made based on simple economics.\nOnce 2015 rolled around, the service had noticeably declined. The overall rating for A Small Orange in 2015 was 43% (only using 2015 data). For years, they had been in the 70's. It also ended the year with a massive outage for most, if not all, of their VPS customers which has been going on since Christmas. I personally received multiple messages from users of this site asking about what was happening and alerting me to this decline in service quality.\nASO was also responsible for the Arvixe migration that went very poorly and caused the Arvixe brand to tank. I'm not sure why EIG doesn't have a dedicated migration team to handle these type of moves considering how many acquisitions they go through and how large a role it plays in their growth strategy. But that's a whole separate issue.\nIt's with great disappointment that I have to admit, the A Small Orange that played such a huge role in the founding and success of Review Signal and provided a great service to many thousands of customers is dead. It's become another hollow EIG brand where the quality has gone down to mediocre levels. And that seems perfectly ok to them, because it's probably more profitable for their bottom line.\nGoing Forward\nThis story has had a profound impact on Review Signal. One thing that it made painfully obvious is that the ranking algorithm needs its first update since inception. The current ranking treats every review equally. Which was great when this site launched, because time didn't have any opportunity to be a factor yet. But as this site continues to move forward, I need to acknowledge that a significant amount of time has passed since launch and today. A review from the beginning of Review Signal isn't as relevant as one from this past week in determining the current quality of a web hosting company. A Small Orange right now shows up around 64% which is artificially high because of their long history of good service and it hasn't been brought down yet by the marginally small (by time scale) decline of the past year. But it's painfully clear that it's not a 64% rating company anymore.\nAnother thing to note is the graphs here all used a simpler calculation [Pos / (Pos + Neg)] to calculate rating without duplicate filtering. What this means is the difference between the rating here and the actual rating on the live site is a measure of the degree people are being positive or negative about a company. If the rating here is higher than the published, it means people are saying on average, more than one good thing about the same company. If the rating is below (as is in most if not all cases here), it means people are are saying more than one negative thing about the company. I'm not sure if this will factor into a new algorithm, but it is something to consider. My intuition says you would see it hinge around 50%, those companies above would likely have more positive supporters, and those below would have detractors.\nIn the coming months I will try to figure out a better way to generate the ranking number that more fairly represents the current state of a company. My initial thought is to use some sort of time discounting, so that the older the review, the less weight it would carry in the rankings. If anyone has experience working with this or wants to propose/discuss ideas, please reach out - comment here, email me, or tweet @ReviewSignal.\nThe following two tabs change content below.BioLatest Posts\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKevin Ohashi is the geek-in-charge at Review Signal.

Art Streiber\n\n\n\nInside Facebook\u2019s Ambitious Plan to Connect the Whole World\nThe stern woman behind the press desk at the United Nations is certain I\u2019ve made a mistake about the person I\u2019m here to see. \u201cMr. Mark Zuckerberg?\u201d she says. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d \u00b6 He\u2019s an Internet executive, I tell her. He started Facebook. It\u2019s the second week of the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly. Several hundred reporters crowd into the press holding area. Nearby, on the main plaza, heads of state stroll by. In this place, it seems, Mark Zuckerberg might as well be Mark Smith.\u00b6 She checks her dog-eared schedule, then makes a call, enunciating into the receiver: \u201cZOO-ker-burg. Mark ZOO-ker-burg.\u201d Silence. \u201cYes, the Facebook guy.\u201d More silence, during which it occurs to me the UN is like the opposite of Facebook. If it had motivational posters on the wall, they\u2019d read: Move slow and break nothing. Finally, she hangs up and turns back to me. Zuckerberg is on the program after all, she concedes, speaking just before German chancellor Angela Merkel.\nA short time later I slip into the back of a two-story amphitheater where Zuckerberg, dressed in a dark suit and a tie, has come to make the case that the Internet should be considered, like health care or clean water, a basic human right. He sees this as the most critical social endeavor of our time. Zuckerberg believes peer-to-peer communications will be responsible for redistributing global power, making it possible for any individual to access and share information. People could tap into government services, determine crop prices, get health care. A kid in India\u2014Zuckerberg loves this hypothetical about a kid in India\u2014could potentially go online and learn all of math. \u201cIt\u2019s the underpinning for helping people get into the modern economy,\u201d he says. \u201cTen years from now, we should not have to look back and accept there are people who don\u2019t have access to that.\u201d\nTwo and a half years ago, Zuckerberg launched Internet.org, a massive endeavor to connect everyone in the world to the web. By his calculations, nearly two-thirds of the global population\u20144.9 billion people\u2014are not connected. Most people, it turns out, do have Internet access available to them, even if it\u2019s crappy. But they can\u2019t afford to pay for it or don\u2019t know why they\u2019d want to. (If you\u2019re feeding a family on $1,570 a year, as average Indian earners do, the web might not seem like a priority.) Roughly 10 to 15 percent of the unconnected live in hard-to-reach places and don\u2019t have access at all.\n\n\nAquila, Facebook\u2019s Internet-delivery drone, has the wingspan of a Boeing 737 passenger jet, weighs less than 1,000 pounds, and can stay aloft for several months at a time. Christoffer Rudquist\n\n\n\nTo reach everyone, Internet.org takes a multipronged approach. Facebook has hammered out business deals with phone carriers in various countries to make more than 300 stripped-down web services (including Facebook) available for free. Meanwhile, through a Google X\u2013like R&D group called the Connectivity Lab, Facebook is developing new methods to deliver the net, including lasers, drones, and new artificial intelligence\u2013enhanced software. Once the tech is built, a lot of it will be open-sourced so that others can commercialize it.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhen you\u2019re looking out at the world from the sunny opportunity factory that is Silicon Valley, this vision sounds wonderful. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t anticipate the extent of the backlash his idealistic undertaking would inspire. Skeptics see his mission as a play to colonize the digital universe. They question the hubris of an American boy billionaire who believes the world needs his help and posit that existing businesses and governments are better positioned to spread connectivity.\nTo address the criticism and sell everyone from global leaders to fellow entrepreneurs on Internet.org, Zuckerberg has transformed himself into an aspiring statesman. In the past year alone, he has \u201cchecked in\u201d on his Facebook profile from Panama, India (twice), and Barcelona, and he has also made it to Indonesia and China. He delivered a speech in Mandarin at Tsinghua University in Beijing and hosted Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at Facebook headquarters. He is working his way through a reading list heavy on political and international-development titles, like Why Nations Fail: the Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  Art Streiber\nFor Zuckerberg, Internet.org is more than just a business initiative or a philanthropic endeavor: He considers connecting people to be his life\u2019s work, the legacy for which he hopes to one day be remembered, and this effort is at its core. Zuckerberg is convinced the world needs Internet.org. The Internet won\u2019t expand on its own, he says; in fact, the rate of growth is slowing. Most companies prioritize connecting the people who have a shot at joining the emerging middle class or who at least have the cash to foot a tiny data plan. Those businesses can\u2019t afford to take a flier on the hardest people to reach\u2014the very poor\u2014in the hope that decades into the future they will transform into a viable market. Zuckerberg can. And as board chair, chief executive, and the majority vote on Facebook\u2019s board, he can compel his board to support him. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can draw a plan about why we\u2019re going to invest billions of dollars in getting mostly poor people online,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut at some level, we believe this is what we\u2019re here to do, and we think it\u2019s going to be good, and if we do it, some of that value will come back to us.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs 2016 gets under way, Zuckerberg has named the Connectivity Lab\u2019s work one of his three top priorities for the year. He plans to launch a satellite above sub-Saharan Africa by year\u2019s end. The first drone test flights will happen shortly. And Facebook has developed new mapping software that takes advantage of AI-enhanced maps to better determine where people need their phones to work. An on-the-ground deployment team is making its way from Kenyan refugee camps to inland villages to hack together new methods for getting people online.\nMeanwhile, Zuckerberg continues to travel to unfamiliar venues\u2014like the United Nations\u2014to promote the work. He finishes his speech, slips out of the amphitheater, and strides to a luncheon, where he joins Merkel and U2\u2019s Bono. At 31, he is a full two decades younger than most of the delegates, business leaders, and dignitaries who dig in to their green beans as he once again steps up to a podium. He speaks: \u201cAccess to the Internet is a fundamental challenge of our time.\u201d\n\n\nYael Maguire, director of engineering at Facebook\u2019s Connectivity Lab.Art Streiber\n\nDirector of engineering Hamid Hemmati came over from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Art Streiber\n\n\n\nThe first time Hamid Hemmati got an email from Mark Zuckerberg, he thought it was spam. A researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the soft-spoken Iranian immigrant had spent several decades figuring out how to help communications travel on lasers. By contrast, Facebook made computer applications; it employed young coders. \u201cI thought, \u2018Just in case this is genuine, I\u2019ll respond,\u2019\u201d he says.\nAs it turned out, Zuckerberg\u2019s interest in lasers was genuine. In the fall of 2013, he\u2019d gathered the Internet.org team together for several meetings. He was joined by Yael Maguire, 40, an MIT Media Lab PhD and engineering director for the Connectivity Lab. Zuckerberg calls Maguire the \u201cinternal and external spiritual leader\u201d for the Connectivity Lab\u2014he\u2019s on top of the science, but he never loses sight of Internet.org\u2019s mission.\nZuckerberg asked Maguire and the rest of the team for new approaches. In the months since Internet.org\u2019s launch, Facebook had trained most of its resources on the things it could achieve right away\u2014making software fixes to improve existing connections, for example, and developing new apps that didn\u2019t use much data. Zuckerberg wanted the lab to make bigger bets, to think about projects that might take a decade to mature but that could reshape what we know about how the Internet is powered. His rule is that Facebook should work on any project that has the potential to increase connectivity by a factor of 10 or to bring down the price of that connectivity by a similar factor.\nAmong the ideas that caught his imagination: data that travels by lasers, sent to Earth from drones. These invisible beams of light provide extremely high bandwidth capacity and are not regulated. Facebook\u2019s laser communications team is working to engineer lasers that transmit data 10 times faster than current versions. The only problem was that the technology to make lasers work on a large scale didn\u2019t exist. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh, well, there\u2019s this optical stuff that in theory could work in the future,\u2019\u201d Zuckerberg remembers. But they said it was a decade away from being commercially viable.\nZuckerberg asked the team for a list of experts. He started emailing them cold, including Hemmati, who then visited Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California, and eventually signed on. \u201cHow often does one get the chance to be a part of a project that could make the world better for billions of people?\u201d Hemmati says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\tSCROLL DOWN\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA sign in Facebook\u2019s laser lab reads \u201cWARNING: SHARKS WITH FRICKIN\u2019 LASER BEAMS ATTACHED TO THEIR HEADS.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpencer Lowell\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nHemmati\u2019s new lab is in a nondescript office park in northern Los Angeles, just beneath the western regional headquarters of the Subway sandwich chain. Bolts and lenses litter the optical tables. A poster reads: \u201cWARNING: SHARKS WITH FRICKIN\u2019 LASER BEAMS ATTACHED TO THEIR HEADS.\u201d\nHe and his team are working on an opportunity that is huge but tricky to realize, as many researchers before Facebook have found. They must fine-tune their ability to aim the lasers. And they must work with the Connectivity Lab to formulate a rainy-day plan\u2014literally. Lasers can\u2019t pass through clouds. As a backup, Facebook is developing software to extend existing mobile phone systems. Satellites could also do the job, though they are very expensive. (Facebook recently partnered with a French company to launch a satellite above sub-Saharan Africa.)\nHemmati is in touch with Maguire almost daily, and Maguire keeps the boss filled in on their progress. Zuckerberg meets regularly with the team for product reviews. It can lead to a productive tension. Zuckerberg, influenced by the quick nature of writing code, always wants to move faster, to release beta versions of various projects, and to talk about them publicly. But Maguire is in charge of, among other things, making large planes. As another colleague, who runs infrastructure for Facebook, explains, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get Mark to understand: This isn\u2019t writing code on a laptop and copying it over to a server. There\u2019s, like, physical stuff. There\u2019s chips and radios and high-powered lasers and planes that could fall out of the sky.\u201d\nFacebook will begin testing its lasers in the field later this year. It will be the first trial of the full delivery system, but to work, that system will need a key component: drones.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\tSCROLL DOWN\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFacebook ultimately wants to launch 10,000 drones like Aquila, moving them around the globe to create hot spots wherever they\u2019re needed.\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristoffer Rudquist\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nHalf the world away, Facebook\u2019s most ambitious connectivity project is being developed in the small industrial town of Bridgwater, three hours west of London. A sign in front of the local pub reads: \u201cHUSBAND BABYSITTING SERVICE.\u201d Drive 10 minutes out and you\u2019ll reach a low brick building marked only \u201c#11,\u201d though everyone knows it\u2019s Facebook. \u201cWe tried to tell people it\u2019s a warehouse,\u201d engineering director Andy Cox says, \u201cbut we\u2019ve had some 10,000 parcels delivered. Everything comes in, but nothing goes out.\u201d \nCox, 53, is in charge of Aquila, Facebook\u2019s passenger jet\u2013sized unmanned aerial vehicle (aka drone). He\u2019s a professorial mechanical engineer who, earlier in his career, built Disney\u2019s Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roller Coaster. More recently, he was part of the team that set the record for keeping a solar-powered UAV aloft for two weeks. He left that project and in 2010 formed an aviation consultancy, Ascenta. In the spring of 2014, a business development guy from Facebook phoned up and offered close to $20 million to buy his group. Nine days later, Cox started working for Zuckerberg. \u201cI brought the oldest team yet to Facebook,\u201d he tells me, describing the aerodynamicist, the structural specialist, and others he brought along. \u201cThere were two at 74, then 65, 57, and then there was me at 51!\u201d \nI visit Cox on the day after he completed the first prototype of Aquila last July. Inside the warehouse, we climb a ladder to get a better look. We are soon nose-to-nose with Aquila, a sleek gray boomerang-shaped drone with the wingspan of a Boeing 737; it\u2019s intended to glide slowly while staying aloft for several months at a time. The entire thing weighs less than 1,000 pounds\u2014about one-hundredth the weight of a passenger plane. \nCox invites me to move in closer, once I remove my watch so I don\u2019t accidentally nick the craft. I see dozens of white chalky circles drawn around areas where someone else wasn\u2019t so careful. Later, Cox will review each with an ultrasound machine to ensure the integrity of the structure. He can\u2019t afford to have a tiny human error derail the progress, particularly when Cox and his team are working on Zuckerberg\u2019s clock. Normally, he says, the development process from concept to flight takes seven years. By outsourcing some of their research to universities, Cox and his team hope to be able to get that down to a little more than a year. By the end of 2016, they aim to test a system that will work like this: A ground station will transmit a radio signal to a drone, which will send that signal to other drones via lasers. The fleet will beam those lasers down to transponders within about 30 miles of each craft. These will convert the signal into Wi-Fi or 4G networks. Facebook has not yet determined the data plan or pricing for this offering. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAndy Cox, engineering lead for Facebook\u2019s aviation team.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPhoto by:\n\t\t\t\tArt Streiber\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThere are many challenges to designing a plane to fly at 65,000 feet\u2014higher than commercial planes and all but a few military aircraft. For one, the air has just 9 percent of the density it has at sea level, so a craft designed for lower altitudes won\u2019t stay aloft. Cox devised a hot-air balloon to lift it up into the sky. The balloon will then deflate, fall to the ground with a tracking device, and be collected and recycled. The team also worked to prevent flutter\u2014a condition that makes the drone vibrate uncontrollably. \nRight now the biggest challenge Aquila faces is regulatory. Facebook has joined with Alphabet (formerly Google) to address bureaucratic obstacles. Its competitor has its own drone effort, Project Titan, incubating under its Access and Energy division. (Project Loon, which aspires to beam the Internet from high-altitude balloons and is part of the Google X lab, is further along than either UAV endeavor and will test a partnership with several carriers in Indonesia this year.) Both companies must cooperate with the Federal Aviation Administration to get permission for test flights\u2014Facebook would prefer to conduct these closer to its headquarters. It intends to fly within an area that Maguire refers to as the \u201cWild West\u201d of airspace, managed in the US by the Department of Defense in collaboration with the FAA. Google and Facebook will also need more spectrum for their projects to work. They have been lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to support an effort by the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunication Union to make specific radio spectrum available for drones. \nUltimately, Facebook wants to launch 10,000 Aquilas and move them around the globe to create hot spots wherever they\u2019re needed. As with most Connectivity Lab projects, the company aims to develop the technology and then release it to outsiders to commercialize it. Facebook has a model for this in its Open Compute Project, which launched over two years ago to build more efficient, economical data centers. Once Facebook made significant progress, it open-sourced its designs. \nThe day after my visit, Cox and his team began to disassemble Aquila, weighing each component and testing the structure and all the motors, transistors, and propellers. Cox expected to fly Aquila last October. The date has since been pushed back several times. This month they\u2019ve been flying a 27-foot scale model, but the stormy El Ni\u00f1o\u2013influenced weather has made even these attempts slowgoing.\n\n\nAn optical table in the laser lab. Spencer Lowell\n\nAn engineering model of a part to be mounted on the drone.Spencer Lowell\n\n\n\nWhile Facebook aims for the sky with its lasers and drones, a growing number of skeptics doubt Zuckerberg\u2019s true intentions. The trouble, which caught Zuckerberg by surprise, centers on Facebook\u2019s attempts to partner with mobile carriers in different parts of the world to launch an app that makes a small group of websites, including Facebook, available to smartphone owners without incurring charges for data. Through the program, called Free Basics, developers can offer lighter versions of their apps that take less time to load, that can work adequately on less robust 2G and 3G networks, and that lure users to want to use more data and become paying customers. \nBut the rollout, which began in 2014, has not gone smoothly. Last April several Indian publishers withdrew their services from the app, claiming Facebook violated net neutrality by colluding with local carriers to offer free access to only a select group of services, putting others at a disadvantage. Zuckerberg responded with a Facebook post stating that Facebook has no intention of blocking or throttling the Internet but is simply giving access to people who otherwise couldn\u2019t get it. \u201cThese two principles\u2014universal connectivity and net neutrality\u2014can and must coexist,\u201d he wrote. \n\t\t\n\t\t\nThen, in early May, Facebook opened its developer platform so anyone could launch a free app. Because of the time difference between Menlo Park and Delhi, it was late in the evening at headquarters when Zuckerberg watched critics begin to pick up steam after the announcement. Incensed, he decided he wanted to address his critics directly. He recorded a video. In it, the lights are off, the desks void of people, as Zuckerberg defends his initiative. He argues for a \u201creasonable\u201d definition of net neutrality, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not an equal Internet if the majority of people can\u2019t participate.\u201d He lists the non-Facebook services that people can use, including Wikipedia, job listings, and HIV education. He concludes with a call to action, saying, \u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what kind of community do we want to be? Are we a community that values people and improving people\u2019s lives above all else? Or are we a community that puts the intellectual purity of technology above people\u2019s needs?\u201d \nHis speech did not appease the naysayers. In mid-May, digital rights groups from 31 countries signed an open letter to Zuckerberg, saying Internet.org \u201cviolates the principles of net neutrality, threatening freedom of expression, equality of opportunity, security, privacy, and innovation.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook responded by changing the name of its app from Internet.org to Free Basics. (The old name sounded too much like the app was the entire Internet.) It also improved app security. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has stepped up his efforts, particularly in India. He hosted prime minister Narendra Modi in Menlo Park in September. In October he returned to India, where he held a town hall meeting at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi. There, he said a million people were using the app in India and that it had so far brought 15 million people online. The skepticism, however, amplified. In December, Indian regulators issued a temporary ban on the service. \nSoon after, Facebook suspended its Free Basics service in Egypt, one of its earliest and most successful markets. Egyptian regulators chose not to renew a two-month permit that had expired. While it would be easy to conclude that the countries had similar concerns,\u00a0in reality the situation is more ambiguous. Neither Egyptian regulators nor Facebook would give an official reason for the service\u2019s shutdown there, but January 25 will mark the fifth anniversary of the Arab Spring uprising that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak. Facebook played a crucial role in organizing demonstrations in 2011. In early January, in a crackdown on activists, security forces arrested three people who administered 23 Facebook pages. While an Egyptian regulator told Reuters the suspension of Free Basics was not related to security concerns, 3 million people had access to the service, according to Facebook, including 1 million who had never before accessed the Internet. \nZuckerberg, who is on paternity leave, continues to engage his critics directly, defending Internet.org\u2019s intentions. In late December, he penned an op-ed for an Indian newspaper: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Facebook\u2019s commercial interests\u2014there aren\u2019t even any ads in the version of Facebook in Free Basics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf people lose access to free basic services, they will simply lose access to the opportunities offered by the Internet today.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\tSCROLL DOWN\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rooftop of the headquarters of Project Isizwe, a South African nonprofit that makes free Wi-Fi available.\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexia Webster\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAs daunting as the skeptics are, they aren\u2019t Zuckerberg\u2019s biggest challenge. It\u2019s people who need to be convinced they need the Internet. In September, I travel to Johannesburg, South Africa, to meet Ryan Wallace, a lanky 38-year-old who used to set up the Internet for the British Royal Navy in far-flung places. He\u2019s drawing on that know-how as part of an Internet.org deployment team. We fly to Polokwane, a city in the impoverished northeast. There we meet James Devine, who works for Project Isizwe, a local nonprofit that makes free Wi-Fi available. Devine and Wallace have forged a partnership in which Facebook finances hot spots in several villages and Isizwe monitors their upkeep. We drive north to check them out. Wallace and Devine are both very excited for me to meet someone they refer to only as the lady with the chicken shack.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhen we arrive in her village, she isn\u2019t there. Instead, a man lounges on a bench beneath a hot spot. He has a Samsung phone\u2014on which he is not surfing the web. \u201cDo you know you can get on the Internet here?\u201d Wallace asks him. The hot spot had been up for a year, and according to the deal he and Devine have struck, users in this area can get a small amount of data for free. And they can check out the services on the Free Basics app\u2014educational scholarships or maternal health information\u2014as much as they want. The guy shrugs. Wallace takes the man\u2019s phone, scrolls to the settings, and ticks the Wi-Fi box, connecting him. \u201cIt\u2019s free,\u201d Wallace says. The man takes his phone back. He isn\u2019t visibly excited.\nFor Zuckerberg, this is the biggest trial of all. Forget the political barriers, the lack of a profitable business model, and the technological hurdles. Forget the drones and lasers. For the Internet to make a difference, people need to want to connect to it in the first place. And figuring out what people want from the web is as varied as the web itself.\nJust then, the lady with the chicken shack drives up in her white pickup truck and pops out to greet us. Her name is Norah Mphedziseni Namalale, but she says her friends call her Pedzi; she is 35. She runs a business selling chicken skewers from a grill beneath the hot spot. She knows everything about it\u2014when it goes down, who uses it, and why. \u201cBut most people aren\u2019t even aware that we have this,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything to let them know. There\u2019s nowhere for them to sit comfortably. They\u2019re afraid that if they come over, I\u2019ll chase them away.\u201d\n\n\nIn Thohoyandou, South Africa, friends meet up after work to socialize and use free Wi-Fi to check the Internet.Alexia Webster\n\nFacebook and Project Isizwe have installed free Wi-Fi outside a school in Tshedza so that teachers and locals can access the Internet. Alexia Webster\n\n\n\nWallace thinks local entrepreneurs like Namalale may be the key to making the Internet take off here. He imagines ways he could enlist her to sell small data packages for local carriers, and, in return, Facebook and Isizwe could build more comfortable seating around her chicken stand. He tells me this model has already worked in Rishikesh, a small town at the mouth of the Ganges in northern India. Perhaps Namalale could be the person to convince the guy with the Samsung phone that he needs the Internet. But that would require many more conversations\u2014and Wallace is part of a very small team of people doing this work in many villages and cities in a dozen countries.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSuch challenges could demoralize anyone. But Zuckerberg is taking a very long view. This past fall, as we discuss the backlash, the drawn-out process of testing the drones, and the challenge of persuading people to get on the Internet, Zuckerberg reflects back to one of his favorite stories from when he first started Facebook. It\u2019s one he\u2019s told me before. It was a few nights after he launched the website. He and his computer science buddy were getting pizza and talking. Zuckerberg told his friend that someone was going to build a social network, because it was too important not to exist. But he didn\u2019t guess, back then, that he\u2019d be the guy to do it. There were older people and bigger companies. So why, then, was Zuckerberg the one to build Facebook? \u201cI think it\u2019s because we cared. A lot of times, caring about something and believing in it trumps,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t connect the dots going forward on Facebook from the beginning. To me, that\u2019s a lot of the story of Internet.org too.\u201d History suggests it\u2019s not a good idea to bet against Mark Zuckerberg.\nSenior staff writer Jessi Hempel (@jessiwrites) wrote about US secretary of defense Ashton Carter in the December 2015 issue of WIRED.\nPortrait grooming by Tamara Brown/Artist Untied\n\n\n\n\t\t\t",

    "scraped_body": "\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\nErik Spiekermann is one of the most well-known and creative thinkers in design. A type, information and graphic designer by trade, he began his career teaching at the London College of Printing in the 1970s. In 1979, Spiekermann co-founded MetaDesign in Berlin, and in the 1980s, at the cusp of the PC revolution, he co-founded FontShop, a distributor of electronic fonts. He has designed fonts such as Berliner Grotesk, ITC Officina, Nokia Sans and FF Meta. He is also the co-founder of design house Edenspiekermann. He divides his time between Berlin and the Bay Area.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nErik Spiekermann has forgotten more things than most successful and creative people know in their lifetime. Now in his sixties (68), the German-born designer and typography guru remains as excited about the future as ever.\n\n\n\nA few years ago a friend invited me to have dim sum at Hakkasan in San Francisco. The high-end Chinese spot is a particular weakness of mine, but what made the prospect even more delicious were the other guests: Erik Spiekermann and Susanna Dulkinys, his business partner who also happens to be his lovely bride.\n\n\n\nThe lunch and subsequent email exchanges led to an invitation to speak at one of my design conferences in San Francisco. Erik was interviewed by Jeff Veen, another modern-day design legend, and they ended up talking about a whole bunch of things, including why fonts on modern digital devices suck. Erik\u2019s plainspeak resonated with the audience and to date, it remains one of my most memorable moments as a conference host.\n\n\n\nSince then we have become friends, though we don\u2019t see each other often. We have the ambient intimacy afforded by modern social platforms, with an occasional email and a rarer meal or a coffee. Last year it was on one such occasion that we ended up having this conversation. It was long, rambling and a lot of fun. I promise there will be a part two in the future!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Story of a Legend\nOm: Erik, I know you are a guru of typography and you are from Germany. But I don\u2019t know much about how you became who you are. Would you mind telling me more about yourself?\nErik: I grew up in the north near Hanover, which is a boring part. Both of my parents went there after the war, even though they came from elsewhere. My father was a truck driver. After he came out of the war, there wasn\u2019t much else to do. He was a mechanic by trade, but he was in the navy.\nThe \u201ctype\u201d thing started early. We lived next door to a printer who was a good friend of my mother\u2019s. This neighbor had a print shop. I used to go in there as a five-year-old. I would get the narrow pieces of paper that they would cut off whatever they were printing, and I would make long drawings.\nA print shop in the old days had a specific smell. It\u2019s ink, petrol and paper and stuff. That\u2019s one thing that I remember really well, hanging out at that shop and seeing all the machinery. I didn\u2019t know what it was at the time.\nAnyway, we moved to Bonn, then the capital. When I was 16, my dad told me to go to Berlin [to avoid getting drafted]. My dad had been in the navy in the stupid U-boats. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want any of my kids to ever wear a uniform, because just fucking Nazis,\u201d as he put it, \u201cstole the best years of my life.\u201d He was one of the few people who survived. Out of 100,000 U-boat guys, only 10,000 survived. He was grateful. He said, \u201cMy sons will never wear a uniform.\u201d\nSo off I went to Berlin at 16 and lived there on my own for a couple years, which was pretty cool. I had little odd jobs. I worked at print shops. I did chalking on the sidewalks and played music. I had to make my own money. My parents didn\u2019t have anything.\nI had always been drawing. I had a little tabletop printing press when I was 12. That\u2019s how I got into the printing part of design. I collected all this equipment in the late \u201960s, because everybody was throwing it away. I had this pretty large letterpress shop. Then, for various reasons \u2014 I won\u2019t go into it. My wife was English. We got chucked out of the house. So we decided to go and live in London. This was in \u201973. Eventually I brought my print shop over there. We went for a vacation, came back, and the place had burned down. There had been a fire next door. Some guys were welding cars. My whole printing press, which was supposed to be my livelihood, was gone.\nIf you\u2019re a printer and you know about type and type settings but you haven\u2019t got equipment, what are you? A graphic designer. Because I could sketch. Instead of doing my own printing, I\u2019d get somebody else to do my printing. Because I know so much about typesetting, I was a consultant for some typesetting companies in London. That\u2019s how I got into type. I also knew the Berthold machines well, and the advertising business in London used those machines. Also, I was metric, and the Brits were trying to go metric, so I had an advantage.\n\nDesign Back in the Day\nOm: What was London like in the 1970s, from a creative standpoint?\nErik: It was great, because there were a lot of things happening ahead of the curve of the rest of Europe. London has always been a creative capital, and in those days new technology was moving into society. The whole corporate design business was actually invented. I mean, it came out of there. There was Landor, but I worked for Wolff Olins, and the two of them, Michael Wolff and Wally Olins, certainly invented the idea that you could have a studio of 60 people and still do cool work. I learned that business and design \u2014 or business and creativity \u2014 aren\u2019t opposites. They need each other.\nOm: Now we talk about \u201cexperience design\u201d as part of the business process. Was it like that in the \u201970s? Did people think about design?\nErik: It was mostly communication, [something to] enhance their business. It would give them the upper hand, or another value. The word \u201cbrand\u201d hadn\u2019t been invented, but that was what we were doing. We were creating and shaping brands, and the good companies saw it. Those are the ones who are still around today. We did work for Audi and VW in the late \u201970s, because at the time they knew it was important to be branded properly, internationally.\n\nOm: When you started MetaDesign in 1979, what was the design process like?\nErik: Because we were German, we were very much about implementation. Making sure you had rules that you could actually follow, because it was monolithic. There was no internet. The English were good at concepts, and then they lost it. That\u2019s actually a good combination, the English with their creativity and their weird ideas and then you get a German to make it work. To tighten all the bolts.\nOn English Eccentricity\nOm: Why do you think the English have weird, creative ideas? I mean, Jony Ive is another example of that. It can\u2019t be the beer that makes them weird.\nErik: No, the beer is lousy. It\u2019s because the Brits are all over the place. There\u2019s the Celtics, the Irish, the Scots and the Germanic part, the French part. The language itself is an amalgam of many languages. Their culture is a total mix of other cultures, but then it\u2019s also preserved because of that island. Everything in England is idiosyncratic. I don\u2019t know how they ever managed to have their stupid empire. I mean, how did the Brits conquer people? That\u2019s another issue, I know, especially with you. How did they rule India, for Christ\u2019s sake? For 200 years.\n\nOm: It\u2019s like why companies become big, right? Microsoft became big not because it was exceptionally brilliant. All its competitors were stupid, like Netscape making bad decisions upon bad decisions. Now Google is not full of super geniuses; it doesn\u2019t have a grand design. I think a lot of its competitors didn\u2019t quite measure up, so it is winning.\nErik: But I think half the English creativity comes from the fact that they have always been an international country. There\u2019s nothing there in Britain. They had a bit of coal and a bit of steel, but it\u2019s not a country that has a lot of resources other than the weird people who went all over the world and brought back \u2014 I mean, they had immigrants there. The first black people I saw were in England. We didn\u2019t have any black people in Germany in the \u201960s. They were all Jamaican bus drivers in London in the \u201960s, when I first went there. Indians? We didn\u2019t have any Indians in Germany in the \u201960s.\n\nWe had nothing. We killed our own Jews and we had no immigrants until the Turks came in. So I wasn\u2019t used to foreign cultures, and in London, everybody was foreign. London\u2019s been like this for a few hundred years, though the Brits wouldn\u2019t admit it. The fact that you go and have a curry. A curry is an English meal. It\u2019s just as English as bangers and mash.\nI think that\u2019s part of it, by definition having been a mixed place whose people have traveled and started colonies and brought English to other countries.\nOm: They make good shoes, though.\nErik: Totally. I used to have English cars all my life. I still have English bicycles. I wish they hadn\u2019t ignored their industrial background. I mean, they invented the Industrial Revolution for chrissake. The Germans only invented chemistry when it came to it, but the British had the mechanics down. They invented the first steam engines. They lost that, for various reasons.\nThey\u2019re still good at making certain things. Maybe it\u2019s because they can\u2019t make things on a large scale, maybe that\u2019s why they are so creative. They start things they never can finish.\nWe go the other way around. We\u2019re not creative in Germany; we\u2019re good at making things. Too good. We always make things 120 percent. You buy anything from us, it\u2019s always over-engineered.\nDesign Changes\nOm: Back in 1979, when you started MetaDesign, was the process still manual? No computers, right?\nErik: I got my first Mac in \u201985 \u201881. I was ahead of the curve. A lot of my clients were from the typesetting industry, so I was quite computer literate, as much as you could be in the late \u201970s. Linotype code was like HTML.\nOm: When did you see the transformation of design business to the computer?\nErik: In 1985 I had the job to design a new typeface for the German post office. I went to Linotype to talk to them about digitizing my sketches, and they had a Macintosh. I had seen photographs but not held one. So I lifted it up and put the little floppy in, and then I borrowed this thing and went over from Frankfurt\u00a0to Bonn,\u00a0to the ministry.\nI went in and told these guys, \u201cThis is typesetting & is the future. And this floppy, which I have in my shirt pocket, has\u00a0the typeface on there.\u201d\nThey looked at each other and went, \u201cThis guy\u2019s gone mad.\u201d But I knew intuitively, just like with the first smell of printed paper, that this was the future of my business.\nI bought this first Mac. I was the first graphic designer to own one in Germany. My friends in the business thought I had gone mad, because it was crummy compared to a piece of typesetting equipment. You had the stupid bitmaps and the tiny black-and-white screen; it took forever.\nThose floppies in there? [Imitates grinding noise] I didn\u2019t even know, but I felt this was going to be the future for our business. I stuck with it, and then I did some work for PageMaker in Seattle in early \u201987.\nI did some work for Apple in \u201986, \u201987. I got the first LaserWriter as payment, which at the time was like 20,000 marks. It was more than a Golf, the car. I did a lot of work for Adobe, and I got free Photoshop and stuff. My instincts had been right.\nI knew everybody, and so we started FontShop in early \u201989. We were the first-ever distributor of fonts. Everybody else sold their own fonts, and we sold everybody\u2019s. Our first catalog was 800 fonts, and then it quickly grew to 330,000. And the Font\u00a0Book, the last one that came out in 2008, was 1,600 pages. And then we stopped printing, because there\u2019s no point printing anymore.\n\nOm: How did you react to the internet when it came out?\nErik: It was a godsend. We started MetaDesign in San Francisco in 1992, and by 1993, when the first browser came out, we designed our first website. We designed a website for IDEO at the time. We did a lot of early websites in 1993, 1994. We worked for Apple. We did some flat interface for them. We did icons for Apple, we did stuff for Adobe, stuff for HP. We worked for all the high-tech guys, so it was obvious that we had to have computers.\nOne of our challenges was to always have the best equipment. We never saved money. We always bought the best equipment: the most expensive computers, the most expensive printers.\nWe made our own color printer in 1990. We bought a Canon 100, and I knew from Adobe that they were working on a RIP, which Adobe wouldn\u2019t admit. And the Canon guy said, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s a copier.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I can make it into a printer.\u201d They said, \u201cNo way.\u201d\nI had these two Dutch guys who hacked a printer driver. We physically soldered it, our own self-made hack to the Canon 100 copier, and made it into a printer before there was anything on the market. I always had some hackers in there, because I wanted to have the coolest shit. We had an A3 color printer, which nobody else did, that I could drive off my Macs in April 1990.\nOm: It\u00a0must have been frustrating for you in the late \u201990s when the internet was exploding, because the typography was so bad.\nErik: Yeah, but it was obvious then. Everybody was complaining, but I said, \u201cJust wait.\u201d I said the same 10\u00a0years ago, and I say the same now about e-books.\nThere\u2019s a tendency for human beings to interface with things that are pleasant to us. It\u2019s taken 600 years, from Gutenberg to now, for the book to achieve the shape that seems to be optimal for our eyes and hands. Everything that is electronic will achieve the same standard. It will be a different substrate, but there is obviously something in it. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have survived for 500 years. The same goes for the screen. I knew it wasn\u2019t going\u00a0to stay\u00a0as bad as that. In \u201991, Adobe published ATM, Adobe Type Manager, when some of the bitmaps went smooth and there was anti-aliasing. I know it has taken 20 years, but now it\u2019s as good if not better.\nThe typesetting you get on the computer these days is way better than anything that had ever happened in metal before. It\u2019s a thousand times better. It doesn\u2019t mean people do it as well, but they can. The tools are the best we\u2019ve ever had.\nPhotoshop! When I saw my first Photoshop demonstration, in \u201987 at Adobe someplace, I thought my world had just opened up. You could put pictures on the screen and manipulate them. I remember that picture so well. There was a guy in a raincoat on some square in Italy with pigeons around him. They took this guy and gave him a motion blur so it looked like he was walking on the computer in real time. I thought I\u2019d died. I knew that this would not only change my world but also expand it tremendously. It\u2019s a threat, but disruptive technology\u2019s what we thrive on.\n\u00a0\nThe Future of the Screen\nOm: Now we have a lot of new things out in the market. For example, Typekit came out. Where do you see web design and tablet design going?\nErik: As always, things are in flux. A lot of things haven\u2019t found their final form yet. Like I said, the book took a few hundred years to find its final shape, which hasn\u2019t been improved on since the 1600s: The binding is still the same. The printing is still the same. It\u2019s gotten better, but the principle hasn\u2019t changed.\nThe same is true for the computer: The interface is there to stay. But we\u2019ll have a flat screen that\u2019s backlit. Tablets haven\u2019t found their final form, our intelligent phones haven\u2019t found their final form. But all these things will coexist, and they\u2019ll also be developed until they have found 100 percent of what they\u2019re good at.\nRight now we\u2019re doing things on certain machines that we shouldn\u2019t be doing. We shouldn\u2019t be reading long text on a standard phone. It\u2019s stupid. We do it because it\u2019s there, but that\u2019s going to go away. The iPad already moved that over. None of these things have matured yet, but they all give a promise. Some of them will disappear.\nOm: Do you think content consumption is defined by screen size?\nErik: There are physical limitations as to certain size. It\u2019s nice to read 10 words a line, 50 to 60 characters. This is science. This is not me. This is something that we like, the way our eyes move in little segments. There are physical limitations to our eyes: the curvature of our eyeballs, the space we have in front of us, the distance from the eyes. That\u2019s human, and no machine can ever change that.\nThere\u2019s a certain size that looks good to us.\u00a0There\u2019s a certain contrast. Total black and total white is horrible. That\u2019s why books are nice, because they\u2019re not totally black or totally white. We like a little softer.\nI download all my German papers. They either come as PDFs, which is pretty stupid, so you have to zoom around, or they come as dedicated apps. What it cuts out is coincidence, happenstance, whatever you call it.\nWhether it\u2019s The New York Times or especially the Frankfurt Allgemeine paper \u2014 a big, large format, twice the size of this \u2014 I open [the paper version] and I find things that I wasn\u2019t looking for. On the screen, you have to have a hierarchy, because you can\u2019t fit so much. You have to look for something. Whereas I open the [printed] page and I will find something I wasn\u2019t looking for, I would have never looked for. I wouldn\u2019t know what to look for. I find things that I wasn\u2019t expecting, and that is enriching. I only need a couple headlines to know it says Ukraine or it says Sochi and I\u2019m done, but the stuff that enriches me is the stuff that I wasn\u2019t expecting.\nIf I read The Economist, which I designed myself, of course, I will go to the contents page, because there I can\u00a0find all. Opening up and relaxing and finding shit, that\u2019s one thing that is prevented by the constraints of the screen.\nWe have different physical demands and psychological, mental, emotional demands that can\u2019t be met by one machine nor by a book nor by a magazine. That\u2019s why all these things coexist, and they will coexist in the future.\nWaste Not, Want Not\nOm: What do you make of the whole internet of things and all these connected devices?\nErik: There\u2019s a great promise as much as a threat. For me, the great promise is that a lot of things that are not happening in this country and other countries \u2014 for example, transport. People get stuck in two hours of traffic jams and stuff; it\u2019s horrible. One guy sitting in a car crossing the bridge is stupid. It could be four people in there, right? And the same goes for buildings. The same goes for anything that 90 percent of the time isn\u2019t being used. That\u2019s one thing I have great hopes for, that whatever equipment we use will be more accessible and therefore more cleverly used.\nIt also means that, of course, the industry will be selling less of those things. Not everybody needs a car anymore. What\u2019s going to happen to the car industry? Which my country totally depends on. The younger people in Germany don\u2019t buy anymore; they use Zipcars or Car2Go or bicycle, trams, taxis. They are pragmatic about transport. There\u2019s going to be a big revolution in transportation in America.\nI think we are going to see a lot of change in the next 10 years there. You have an app; you know when you can get on the bus or in a car or bicycle. You don\u2019t have to chance it. So you can plan your day without having your own car. That\u2019s a great promise.\nThe same goes for the waste of energy that happens in our houses every moment. All day we are heating up water that we use once a day. The issue is with the stupid tanks here, which we don\u2019t have back home, heating a whole house. Then there\u2019s lighting streets, lighting bridges, lighting stations when there is nobody there. All that stuff will go away \u2014 that\u2019s my great hope. It\u2019s going to take at least 25 years, another generation.\nOm: In a conversation a couple of years ago you were critical of Apple\u2019s use of Helvetica Neue. I wonder now that we are in the mobile age, Why aren\u2019t we inventing special mobile-first fonts?\nErik: We have some, just Apple chose not to [use them]. Steve Jobs loved Helvetica, and they put it in there. It\u2019s rubbish. I designed the Mozilla typeface called Fira, which is meant for mobile. It does way better on screen than Helvetica. Mobile fonts are doable, but for some reason are behind there.\nOm: Why do you think no one is doing it?\nErik: It\u2019s ignorance, because these are engineering companies. Essentially, so is Apple. Jony is a mate\u00a0of mine, and he is a good designer, but he is more of an engineer. He is surrounded by these kids in their twenties, and they go for whatever is trendy. For some reason there is nobody in management to tell these guys to go to us for some advice.\nThey\u2019re all bound by these 25-year-olds who pick whatever is trendy. [The mobile app] hasn\u2019t got into their culture yet, but it will, I\u2019m quite sure. User experience and user interface are becoming so important. In the end, that\u2019s going to make successful products.\nAdvice for the Next Generation\nOm: If you were to give advice to younger designers, web developers, web app makers, what would you tell them?\nErik: Learn as much about our culture as you possibly can, by reading, by traveling, by involving yourself in things that go on. But don\u2019t become an artist. Don\u2019t think, \u201cI\u2019ll do it intuitively.\u201d You have to learn if not to code at least to appreciate code, to understand code. Because code is what nuts and bolts were a hundred years ago.\nIf you don\u2019t know anything about mechanics, you can\u2019t survive in this world. If you don\u2019t know anything about how a computer works or code works, as a communicator, which is what a designer is \u2014 the interface between machines and man, that\u2019s what we are. We are the interface, we interpret what the machine says into visible language. If you don\u2019t understand how the machine works, you\u2019re going to be laughed out of the room by the engineering guys, because you can\u2019t communicate with them.\nOm: Do you feel satisfied with your career and what you have achieved so far?\nErik: It\u2019s difficult, because I never thought I had a career. I never had any plans. I just did shit because it came up, and I got out of MetaDesign on bad terms. There was a major design issue\u00a0that we all disagreed on, and I left. It\u2019s still going, but it\u2019s not me anymore. That was a major black spot in my history, as it were, that I never managed to finish that.\nBut other than that, yes, whatever I\u2019ve touched, I\u2019ve never made a loss. I\u2019ve created work for a few hundred people. A few hundred families have survived because I have had ideas and I\u2019ve started businesses. In that way I\u2019m quite proud. But I can\u2019t measure my advancement, my success or anything, because I never had a young self who said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a million.\u201d I never sat down and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this.\u201d It just happened. It\u2019s chaotic.\nA few years ago Eye Magazine realized that everyone they talk to in Berlin worked with me at one time. So they had this chart of about 600 people that work on their own or have their own studios or whatever, and they all worked with me at one time. That\u2019s been my major achievement, that I\u2019ve empowered a couple of generations of designers in Germany, America and Britain.\nPhotos courtesy of Erik Spiekermann by Cliff Englert\u00a0and Erik Spiekermann.\t\t\t\t\t\n",

The entire set of modules clocks in at 3.5KB* minified and gzipped. Crafted with mobile devices in mind, it was important to us to keep our file sizes small, and every line of CSS was carefully considered. If you decide to only use a subset of these modules, you'll save even more bytes.* We can add correctly :) the numbers above are individual module sizes; when grouped together they compress (gzip) even more.Pure builds on Normalize.css and provides layout and styling for native HTML elements, plus the most common UI components. It's what you need, without the cruft.Pure is responsive out of the box, so elements look great on all screen sizes.Pure has minimal styles and encourages you to write your application styles on top of it. It's designed to get out of your way and makes it easy to override styles.By using Grids, Menus, and more, it's easy to create beautiful responsive layouts for all screen sizes. We've made it easy for you to get started. Take a look at a few different layouts and start your next web project with a rock-solid foundation.View LayoutsUnlike other frameworks, Pure's design is unopinionated, minimal and flat. We believe that it's much easier to add new CSS rules than to overwrite existing rules. By adding a few lines of CSS, you can customize Pure's appearance to work with your web project.Extend Pure",

    "scraped_body": "  No one could accuse Diana Kennedy of cowardice. The 92-year-old Englishwoman lives in an adobe house in Michoac\u00e1n, three hours west of Mexico City, where she writes about Mexican food culture. She  has seen off extortion attempts by the local police. She isn\u2019t bothered by nearby drug traffickers. She travels through the provinces of Mexico in an old jeep, in which she also sleeps. She takes a  spade with her so she can dig the wheels out of the mud when necessary. \u2018I never travel in straight lines,\u2019 she says.  Serene, Kennedy is not: she\u2019s intelligent, abrasive and up for a fight. Margarita Carrillo Arronte\u2019s Mexico: The Cookbook appeared in 2014, and Kennedy had been asked by Phaidon for a  blurb: reading the proofs she saw more than an overlap between the book and work of her own. She refused to write the blurb, and when the book was published had someone put a review on Amazon, quoting what she wanted to say. \u2018With at least 60  mistakes and 16 recipes of mine used, without my permission or acknowledgment, this book is not to be taken seriously. Shame on the Phaidon editors and their ridiculous promotional blurbs!\u2019  Kennedy's assertions were supported by David Sterling, an American chef and the author of an anthropologically-minded book on  the cuisine of Yucatan. In his Amazon review, he said: \u2018Diana Kennedy's negative comments about this book seen elsewhere in this column of reviews have nothing to do with any sort of vendetta or  \u201csour grapes\u201d. She is upset, as am I, because of the great disservice this book does to the understanding of regional Mexican cuisine beyond the country, an understanding that Diana has worked hard  to build since the 1950s. The book is full of egregious errors, cover to cover, in fact on almost every page.'  The Amazon reviews, and the threads leading from them, are now the length of a book, and while the contest might seem overblown \u2013 more evidence of too much boring talk about food \u2013 Kennedy is far  more than just a writer of cook books. \u2018All anthropologists and botanists, they ought to learn to cook,\u2019 she has said, \u2018or they will miss the whole point of how culture and plants and food come  together.' She was born in Essex, spent the war in the Women\u2019s Timber Corps measuring the girth of trees, met a New York Times journalist in Haiti, and moved with him to Mexico. Craig  Claiborne, the paper\u2019s legendary food critic, told her that he would only be persuaded Mexican cooking was a distinct cuisine if she wrote a book explaining why it was. So she did.  If Kennedy is following in the footsteps of anyone, it\u2019s Hans Sloane, whose colossal collection of books and objects were the foundation of the British Museum. His account of his years in the  Caribbean, especially Jamaica, included observations on what there was to eat, and what there wasn\u2019t. Cooking and ingredients familiar in Britain turned bad too quickly in the tropics; dishes that  lived in Lincoln died in Kingston. That can still be true, and I learned my own lesson in Mexico when I tried to show off by making my hosts in Malinalco a cheese souffl\u00e9. It didn\u2019t work, and I was  told by a brain-box Mexican-French economist a few days later, who knew everything about everything (he'd written his PhD on the irrigation and redirection of the Durance river in Provence, had his  own morels in his own woods, and had worked for Carlos Salinas in the 1980s), that at 5000 feet above sea-level you have to rethink how you whisk those egg whites.  In an inspired piece on her blog about British 18th-century taste, Homo Gastronomicus,  India Mandelkern explains how Sloane\u2019s thinking developed into an inquiry into what food is and what about we take for granted.    So alien were these Jamaican foods, so distasteful were they to the European palates, that Sloane began to ponder the very definition of food in the first place. After all, Sloane surmised, there    was no hard and fast rule separating \u2018food\u2019 from \u2018non-food\u2019. What was unique about mankind, Sloane reasoned, was the ability to extract nourishment from pretty much anything. But necessity alone    does not determine one\u2019s taste preferences. \u2018[H]owever strange to us,\u2019 Sloane continues, strange and un-food-like foods \u2018are very greedily sought after by those us\u2019d to them. Thus Person not us\u2019d    to eat Whales, Squirrils, or Elephants, would think them a strange Dish; yet those us\u2019d to them, prefer them to other Victuals.\u2019    There\u2019s probably no better contemporary book that illustrates the food/non-food question than Diana Kennedy\u2019s Oaxaca al Gusto: An Infinite Gastronomy. The book is exotic less for its  unlikely ingredients, although there are plenty of them, than for its variety: throughout the province of Oaxaca, there are thousands of valley-specific dishes. Unlike most contemporary cookbooks,  where you can, if you think about it, imagine the taste of the dish you\u2019re confronted by, in Oaxaca al Gusto there is almost no recognition at all. The book has never been published in the  UK; the British Library doesn\u2019t have a copy.  \u2018Are we in fact what we eat?\u2019 Mandelkern asks. 'It\u2019s a well-worn adage, but Dr. Sloane didn\u2019t seem to think so. In fact, precisely because the definition of food was so malleable, Sloane concluded  that one\u2019s dietary preferences should not be a pretext to classify, categorise and enslave other peoples.' A radical thought. Kennedy\u2019s books ask similar questions. \u2018I had no vision,\u2019 she said in  an interview about how she got going as a writer in the late 1960s. \u2018I was just putting down what I found. I never thought of myself as a writer. I never thought of myself as anything.\u2019 Quite  something, that.",

    "scraped_body": "engine.js\nExample\nSee \"example/example.html\".\nUsage\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"engine/dist/engine.min.js\"></script>\nThis will expose engine on the global object.\nAlternatively if using require.js, simply require the distribution file.  No global will be exposed.\nengine.Controller\nnew Controller(el) (constructor)\nInstantiate a new Controller.  el can be a reference to an element, or a string element selector.  The controller will be rendered as a direct child of the element.\n(instance).generateHTML(data)\nGenerate the view based on the data (see datasources).  This method should return a string of HTML and must be implemented by you.  Generally this is as simple as passing the data and some specific template for the controller to your favorite templating engine.\n(instance).datasources\nAn object or array of objects of the following format:\n{\n    key : function(data) { return 'value'; },\n    // ...\n}\n\nDatasource object keys and values get mapped directly to a data object that is passed to generateHTML.\nex:\n{\n    foo : function(data) { return 'bar'; },\n    fizz : function(data) { return 'buzz'; }\n}\n\ndata -> { foo : 'bar', fizz : 'buzz' }\n\ndata is a clean copy for each datasource function invocation, so any mutation (including sorting) that occurs will not be reflected downstream.\nObject value functions can return an immediate value or a promise.  If a value function returns the result of a call to model.get, the controller will automatically re-render itself if the value retrieved from model is updated.\nAdditionally, datasource keys within an object will be resolved in parallel, while objects within an array will be resolved in serial.\nex:\n[{\n    foo : function(data) { return 'bar'; },\n    fizz : function(data) { return 'buzz'; }\n},\n{\n    hello : function(data) { return 'world'; }\n}]\n\nfoo and fizz will be resolved together, and hello will be resolved only once foo and fizz are.  In this way, asynchronous operations such as xhr calls can be grouped in parallel if they are not interdependent, or arranged in serial if they are.  data will contain intermediately resolved values along the way.\n(instance).start(callback)\nRender the controller - this will resolve all datasources and call generateHTML.  Generally you only need to call this method once in order to kick things off - any model changes will automatically cause a re-render.  Re-renders are achieved via DOM diffing, so UI state such as input focus or scroll position is preserved.  Calls to start will cancel any other pending start calls for the controller in order to prevent race conditions.\nCallback will be called when that particular rendering call has completed.\nWill return this for chaining.\n(instance).children\nAn optional object where the key is an element selector, and the value is a function that will be invoked with an element reference matching the selector in the key.  This function should return an un-started child that is instantiated with the supplied element reference.\nex:\n{\n    '.child': function(el) {\n        return new Child(el);\n    },\n    ...\n}\n\nThis is allows for arbitrary composition of controllers.\n(instance).events\nAn optional object where the key is a string starting with a native DOM event type, followed by a space, followed by any number of element selectors, and the value is an event handler that will be invoked with the event and bound to the controller instance.\nex:\n{\n    'change input': function(event) { ... },\n    ...\n}\n\nExactly the same as Backbone.View.events.  Will only detect events from the controller's direct view, and not from child views.\n(instance).own(f)\nAdd a cleanup function to be called when the controller is destroyed.\nWill return this for chaining.\n(instance).disown(f)\nRemove a previously added cleanup function.\nWill return this for chaining.\n(instance).destroy()\nDestroy all ownables and remove the controller.  Will automatically remove all event listeners added via events.  Also destroys all of the controller's children.  Once a controller is destroyed, it should be completely cleaned up and cannot be re-rendered.\nWill return this for chaining.\nengine.model\nget(key, callback)\nGet a value by key.\nCallback will be called with an object like:\n{\n    key: key,\n    value: value\n}\n\nIf your value is an object, it will be returned as a frozen copy.\nWill return this for chaining.\nset(key, value, callback)\nSet a value at a key.\nCallback will be called when the value is set (generally applicable to stores that perform asynchronous operations).\nWill return this for chaining.\ndestroy(key, callback)\nRemove a key\\value pair from the model.\nCallback will be called when the value is removed (generally applicable to stores that perform asynchronous operations).\nWill return this for chaining.\nobserve(key, f)\nObserve changes to a key.  The callback f will be invoked with a frozen copy of the updated value whenever it is changed.\nWill return a function that can be invoked to stop observing.\nregisterStore(name, store)\nRegister a store.  A store is just a place to put your data, for example you might implement an xhrStore or a localStorageStore (see examples).  Stores must implement get(key), set(key, value), and destroy(key).\nWill return this for chaining.\nregisterStoreForKey({ key, store })\nRegister a key to be backed by a specific store.  By default, all keys are backed by the memory store (JS heap).\nWill return this for chaining.\nTests\nTo run the test suite, open \"test/test.html\"\n",

    "scraped_body": "Maybe Steve Jobs was right after all.The late Apple CEO famously said consumers wouldn\u2019t buy huge smartphones, noting that people don\u2019t\u00a0want a device \u201cyou can\u2019t get your hand around.\u201dApple, of course, ended up following the lead of its rivals after Jobs\u2019s death, incrementally increasing the size of its smartphone before supersizing the iPhone 6 and 6S, as well as their Plus (read: extra-large) counterparts.Since then, the company has reported multiple quarters of record-breaking earnings, largely fueled by its mega phones. And while the strategy has clearly paid off, it appears there\u2019s a group of holdouts\u00a0(this reporter included) who are not quite ready to make the jump to full-fledge phablet.In Apple\u2019s earnings call Jan. 26, CEO Tim Cook revealed that 60% of iPhone owners\u00a0from before September 2014\u2014when the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched\u2014have not upgraded to Apple\u2019s larger phones.The iPhone 5S,\u00a0the last model before Apple went the phablet route,\u00a0was launched in September 2013. Based on Cook\u2019s stat, that means a majority of existing iPhone owners\u00a0have chosen to hold\u00a0onto smartphones now more than two years old (a relative relic) or have switched over to Android.There are many reasons why people might buck the traditional two-year-upgrade cycle, but keep in mind the primary differences between the 5S and the iPhones that follow are the size\u00a0and the availability of Apple Pay. The latter isn\u2019t likely a reason for not upgrading since users can simply choose not to use the mobile wallet.It appears Apple is acutely aware of the big-phone holdouts. A recent article by 9to5Mac\u2019s Mark Gurman\u2014who has a remarkable track record for reporting Apple leaks that turn out to be true\u2014suggests the company is preparing to launch a 4-inch iPhone 5se\u00a0(essentially the iPhone 5S with a sleeker design and new innards)\u00a0this spring.In the past, Cook had characterized the gap between those who have and haven\u2019t upgraded as \u201cheadroom,\u201d or opportunity to get its\u00a0customers to buy\u00a0new devices. But there was no such language in the company\u2019s most recent earnings\u00a0call. Instead, Apple gave out new revenue forecasts for the current quarter that fall\u00a0short of expectations amid news reports it\u2019s\u00a0slashing orders for the\u00a0iPhone.Perhaps Apple could revitalize sales by giving these holdouts what they want: a new iPhone\u2014but one that\u2019s moderately sized.",

Guess what? People like us\u2026we don\u2019t get a choice.\u201d \u2014 Peter ParkerHave No Fear! Spidey is Here!The amazing spidey powers of Amazon Web Services (AWS) API\u2019s provides developers the ability to provision their infrastructure instantly, and rebuild services as often as the application\u2019s code base. That\u2019s the beauty of DevOps \u2014 the \u201cshift left\u201d and automation of operational considerations into the hands of development teams to enable their continuous flow of delivery.With legacy on-premise data center environments, adherence to stringent security, network, and operational controls are included in the lengthy provisioning of infrastructure. As the power to provision infrastructure shifts directly into the hands of the developers, so does the responsibility to build similarly secure environments.This responsibility shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.In the federated model of DevOps punctuated by the self-service infrastructure capabilities of AWS, there is a pressing need for development teams to be keenly aware of operational considerations that may have previously been taken for granted.DevOps + SecDevOps is an overloaded term. \u201cDev\u201d compromises an assorted web of tools and techniques that go into building software. \u201cOps\u201d is weighed heavily by the multitude of functions that ensure the resiliency of production environments \u2014 including the oft-overlooked complexities of security.As development teams absorb the many facets of \u201cOps\u201d into their flow, security needs to be a forethought. By including security considerations early and often in the delivery pipeline, DevOps provides enterprises a unique opportunity to improve their security defenses.The automation of the delivery pipeline allows applications to embed security from the earliest stages of development. By leveraging CI/CD practices such as Automated Test Driven Development (ATDD), security requirements can be tested with every build providing a much tighter and more integrated feedback loop.Train Like Spider-ManAfter being bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker gained several amazing powers. The combination of these abilities made him one of the most powerful crime-fighting superheroes.To combat the anti-pattern foes of your continuous delivery pipeline, you\u2019ll need similar mad skills:Spider-Strength: Be strong and resilient by designing your application for failure. Adopt AWS best practices for high availability, such as using multiple Availability Zones and configuring Auto Scaling groups to replace unhealthy instances.Spider-Speed: Deploy your application with speed and agility by automating tests, builds, and deployments to eliminate the need for error-prone manual operations.Spider-Grip: Adhere to the underlying DevOps principles that include Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing. Don\u2019t lose your grip \u2026 Stay CALMS and DevOps.Spider-Sense: Use automated log monitoring and alerts throughout the delivery pipeline to amplify the feedback loop and quickly \u2018focus-in\u2019 on the source of the danger.Take responsibility of the great power afforded to you by becoming familiar with the basic security concepts and services of AWS. As operations \u201cshift left\u201d into development teams, security should be an integral part of your automated delivery pipeline.It won\u2019t be long before you get the swing of it, and are spinning a secure web to combat the villain of DevOps: Anti-Patterns.There will always be doubters, cynics, and haters telling you that becoming Spider-Man isn\u2019t possible. Just remember that \u201cscientists\u201d also said waterfall methodology was suitable for software development.",

The ease with which the happy few become suddenly rich lends credence to the belief in magical transformation.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aLewis Lapham, 1979, \u201cLost Horizon\u201d\n\u201cWhen do you think people in the Bay Area started to realize that you could make more money from tech than from real estate?\u201d Jed Kolko asked me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were sitting at Ma-velous, a coffee shop frequented by San Francisco\u2019s political movers two blocks from City Hall and kitty corner from Twitter\u2019s headquarters in the Shorenstein-owned former San Francisco Furniture Mart.\nJust outside the window was Market Street, San Francisco\u2019s main thoroughfare. In 1847, two years before the Gold Rush transformed the city into a teeming boomtown, a 30-year-old Irish immigrant named Jasper O\u2019Farrell presciently surveyed the street to be 120 feet wide\u200a \u2014 which is broader than the Philadelphia main street it was named after\u200a \u2014 even though the city was only 500 residents strong at the time.\n\u201c1980s,\u201d I said in response to his question. Seemed obvious. The PC revolution. Steve Jobs and Apple. And a decade after the Peninsula was christened \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d by an electronics trade newsletter and the \u201cFairchildren,\u201d or alumni of Fairchild Semiconductor, went on to found Intel, National Semiconductor and AMD.\n2005 was his guess. The year after Google IPO-ed,\u00a0and when escalating home prices made real estate an ever-riskier bet.\u00a0That was the year that he felt that more people started coming to San Francisco for professional ambition rather than lifestyle reasons such as being openly gay or for pursuing callings that didn\u2019t need to be so well-compensated.\nLike a handful of other people at the intersection of real estate and technology, Kolko would be in a position to make an educated stab. He led some research at the well-regarded nonprofit, non-partisan think tank\u00a0Public Policy Institute of California\u00a0for five years, and then was the head economist at real estate startup Trulia.\nIt was a provocative rhetorical question.\u00a0Land, labor, capital.\u00a0Technological change.\u00a0How do they intersect?\n\nIn some ways, we\u2019re lucky that the first two decades involving the advent of the commercial Internet were largely a positive-sum game. The creation of digital space for self-expression, at near-zero cost, does not necessarily challenge or erode someone else\u2019s right to space or resources.\nThat makes it easy to forget that California is a state built throughout generations of conflict over land and its inherent constraints. It is this oldest of resources\u200a \u2014 not capital or human talent or ingenuity\u200a \u2014 that most constrains the region\u2019s potential for workers at all income levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCities, or physical communities, are one of the hardest kinds of scaling problems that exist. The infrastructure needed to sustain bigger networks, such as\u00a0schools, sewers and mass transit, gets harder\u200a \u2014 not easier \u2014 \u200ato develop, finance and maintain the larger your population becomes.\nThere are countless constituencies of different incomes, racial groups, interests and professions that are all vying with each other for limited space. Although it\u2019s possible to build up, urban development is much more of a zero-sum game.\nWith every major economic shift\u200a, \u200afrom an agrarian to an industrial economy, and then an industrial to a knowledge-and-services economy\u200a, California and the United States have faced distinctive junctures in their approach to land-use and housing.\nI believe we\u2019re hitting\u00a0another major juncture, although I don\u2019t know when it will deteriorate to the point\u00a0that it forces real\u00a0reform. California\u2019s fragmented, post-war suburban model, which was created for a more even wage distribution in a mass industrial economy, is clearly becoming more dysfunctional by the year for a knowledge-and-services economy with a wider level of income stratification.\nNot only are we not building enough housing overall, we have scarce sources of funding for supporting those on the lower-earning ends of a rapidly widening income spectrum. So we end up politicizing and extracting funds out of new construction even though we are 40 years deep into a largely self-imposed housing shortage.\nThere are a couple of disturbing trends showing up in the data. If you look across the state\u2019s workforce, Californians born in 1990 are on average spending 50 percent of their income on housing. That\u2019s way above the 30-percent-of-income level that is generally considered to be the threshold of whether housing is affordable or not in public policy conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, if you look at working-class segments, commutes are rapidly rising for the lower-income workers in the region:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is troubling because commute time is one of the strongest predictive factors in determining a child\u2019s chances of climbing from the lowest income quintile to the highest-earning one. That morning and evening time between parents and children that is taken up by commuting is invaluable for bonding and child development.\nCities around the Bay Area are starting to contort themselves into stranger and stranger positions just to support basic public services. Suburbs like Cupertino, where Apple is headquartered, are now having to build teacher public housing projects for tens of millions of dollars because the cost of living is too high for an entry-level teacher making $55,000 a year.\nMeanwhile, the city has approved another Apple campus that will bring 13,000 additional Apple employees to the city, while only committing to building 1,400 housing units over the next seven years.\nI\u2019m not sure when a breaking point happens, but I want to offer some essays and short pieces over the next few\u00a0days to give you a couple of takeaways. The TL;DR is that I\u2019m going to start working on new projects soon, but I want to leave a map behind of what I think has to be done long-term in Northern California.\nHere are\u00a0the additional pieces (and I\u2019ll be posting more in the days to come):\n\nNothing\u00a0Like This Has Ever Happened Before\n\nAn old problem\nCalifornia has faced housing and land shortages multiple times and has changed its regulatory regimes in response.\u00a0I\u2019m going to start with\u00a0two histories from the state\u2019s first Gilded Age and post-war era.\nIn the first Gilded Age, the concern was over land monopolization by a handful of large-scale owners and how that crowded out and impoverished labor. In the postwar period, California leveraged the automobile and federal subsidies to unlock previously inaccessible land and create a golden age of cheap housing and suburbanization.\nThis boom period ended in the 1970s as the state\u2019s flat, developable coastal lands were built out and the oil crisis made sprawl more expensive. That\u2019s when\u00a0housing shifted from being perceived as a consumable good to an investable asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, a new generational land cartel has emerged with Californian Baby Boomers protecting\u00a0entitlements and higher property values for themselves in the form of land-use restrictions and Proposition 13. Global capital has been subverting and taking advantage of these favorable legal and taxation protections on real estate in a extremely low\u00a0interest-rate world. All of this has come at the cost of the state\u2019s working and middle class and its future workforce.\nIt\u2019s a global issue\nIt faces major cities in all economies that chose a housing-as-an-investable-asset model following World War II like the U.K. and Australia.\nAfter the credit-fueled housing crises of the 2000s tested the upper bound of what the homeownership rate could be, many countries are grappling with lower homeownership rates for the foreseeable future. This raises questions about what the future balance of tenant and homeowner rights and subsidies should look like.\nThere are alternate approaches in industrialized countries like Germany and Japan that make housing more of a consumable good rather than an appreciable asset, but it\u2019s hard to see how we could ever shift toward those models since there is so much national wealth tied up in housing.\nCalifornia is mostly\u00a0half-assing solutions\nThere is no \u201cmagical transformation\u201d here (unless VR and telepresence renders location obsolete, which the Internet certainly didn\u2019t do). Technology companies and political leaders completely underestimate the depth of reform that\u2019s needed to actually solve housing affordability.\nRight now, San Francisco and New York City are reliant on inclusionary zoning, which effectively taxes the production of new housing in order to finance subsidized, affordable housing. It\u2019s a Band-Aid solution that lets everyone stay in a system structured to keep property values higher (e.g. making housing less affordable) while providing a teeny-tiny, token amount of low-income housing.\nFor example, inclusionary housing has produced 1,787 below-market-rate units and $59 million in affordable housing fees in San Francisco since 1993. Meanwhile, the value of the city\u2019s assessed property rose\u00a0by $11 billion in the last year.\u00a0We need to capture more of the land value increases that property owners are accruing through no particular special effort of their own, perhaps in the form of a deferred transfer tax at sale. Unfortunately, most jurisdictions in the state are designed to be majority homeowner, and the state\u2019s Third Rail, Proposition 13, hasn\u2019t been touched since the late 1970s. It\u2019s hard to see a political constituency that could change this unless it gets really bad.\nThat said, California\u2019s homeownership rate is the lowest it\u2019s been since 1991 and has dropped a full 6\u00a0percentage points since the financial crisis to 54.2 percent. Maybe we just have to wait another 10 to 15 years until the composition of the electorate changes enough for reform.\nIt has to do with the way we deal with land.\nWhile the technology industry and its compensation practices have increased the region\u2019s income inequality over the last generation, taxing businesses, wealth or investments alone for affordable housing funds won\u2019t solve the housing issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDumping hundreds of millions of dollars of public or philanthropic capital down a badly designed property system will not get you very far because it will drive land values even higher, producing an unearned windfall for property owners.\nFor San Francisco to build affordable housing in the Mission District today, private land owners are demanding $250,000 per housing unit in just land costs from the San Francisco city government\u00a0because they can. The Latino community fought and used the threat of a moratorium on new housing construction to wrestle $50 million out of the $310 million bond that voters approved last fall. It\u00a0was the first affordable housing bond the city had passed\u00a0in almost 20 years.\u00a0But then the Mission\u00a0community\u00a0realized that $50 million gets you \u2014 drum roll \u2014 three plots of land!\nKeep in mind that California also already has the most progressive income taxation system of any state in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0because it also has\u00a0some of the lowest property tax rates, especially on properties worth more than $1 million.\u00a0The\u00a0downside of being extremely reliant on income and capital gains taxes and having low property taxes is that the California state government\u2019s revenue structure is highly volatile and predictably goes into steep deficits during recessions.\nSo while you could go down this route \u2014 and there are\u00a0interesting conversations\u00a0about progressive equity, tech executive compensation\u00a0and carried-interest loopholes \u2014\u00a0you\u2019d have to do it in addition to land-use and property taxation reform to have any real impact on housing affordability.\nAn economic downturn\u00a0won\u2019t bring lasting\u00a0affordability\nAn economic downturn may soften pressure on local housing markets, but it will not fix this problem. The Bay Area\u2019s housing market tends to rise and then plateau; this is a function of how local land markets work.\nEven though developers tend to get pilloried in the public process, it is the land owners that get egged on by local brokers to sell at the absolute highest price. Because there is no structural disincentive to sitting on underutilized land because of property tax caps, land owners can just sit a weak cycle out, withhold their land from the market and wait for the next upswing.\nWhile there are quasi-public institutions that sustain mortgage and home-buying demand through weak parts of the economic cycle, there isn\u2019t really an equivalent on the construction financing side. When markets turned in 2008, project financing evaporated, which left the city without a decent construction pipeline until it was too late in the up-cycle. The same thing may happen in the next downturn.\nBeyond the Bay\nIf the tech industry\u00a0wants a faster solution than waiting for several decades of reform, it\u00a0could\u00a0decentralize and encourage\u00a0more viable tech hubs elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Detroit\u2019s automobile industry was around the same age that Silicon Valley is today, it began decentralizing production in the 1940s, decades before the 1967 race riots and competition from Asian automakers.\nHowever, even if tech decentralizes a little bit, the state\u2019s working- and middle-class are still screwed because these are issues that are deeply rooted in California\u2019s approach to land-use and property taxation that stretch back decades. They\u2019re visible all over the state well outside of Silicon Valley.\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n                                \n            Jeana Lee Tahnk is a high-tech PR consultant and writer who focuses on technology and parenting. She pens the Screen Play technology blog for Parenting Magazine and also writes for Cool Mom Tech and more.It's amazing how much technology has changed over the past decade and how ingrained it has become in our society. And this is just the beginning. While a Mission Impossible-like society with holographic billboards, levitation technologies and GPS contact lenses scares the dickens out of me, I can honestly say that technology has truly paved the way for a more organized and efficient life. And it's made me a better mom in the process.On a day-to-day basis, I use my iPhone constantly. Between work and a busy family life and being pregnant with baby #3, I have a lot of balls in the air. I've found this invaluable gadget to be my savior in certain situations, enough for me to frequently ponder how I managed to juggle everything in what I call the period \"B.I.\" (before iPhone).Who knows what kind of technology we will see in the \"A.I.\" decade? When it comes to tech, I\u2019m actually very selective, always trying to find a balance between old school and new school. But there are some technologies that have made my life as a parent so much easier.\nI'm More OrganizedI can multitask with the best of them, but managing the family\u2019s sports, social, parties and activities calendar is a job meant for a robot. B.I., when I would get a note sent home about a field trip, class picture or school concert, I would stick it on the fridge. You can imagine what my fridge looked like. A.I, it goes straight into my digital calendar (and the family\u2019s shared Google Calendar) so I get automatic reminders, making it nearly impossible to forget things. Plus, you can actually see my fridge now!I Save ArtworkSpeaking of fridges, interspersed with all those notices were also layers and layers of artwork that the kids would bring home. While some were definitely worth saving, some were, um, not at all. If you have ever experienced the trauma of your child finding a piece of artwork in the trash, you know never to make that mistake again. There are so many great apps now for preserving all that beautiful artwork, whether it\u2019s a full masterpiece or a scribble, and making sure that your kid\u2019s 1st grade rendition of you is preserved in perpetuity.I Get There FasterNo, not because technology has made me a faster driver, but because GPS gets me where I'm going. I remember using MapQuest for directions and always having to print them or write them out. Driving around in an unfamiliar area, while trying to read small print on a white piece of paper wasn\u2019t the most efficient (or safest) way to drive. Now, with GPS, I can get to places on time.I Share MemoriesThe easy accessibility of my iPhone camera has definitely increased my picture/video-taking pastime. Having to hook up the camera and download pictures was always a hassle that I didn\u2019t want to deal with. Now, I can order prints, share kid memories with friends and family, even create photo books in just a few taps.I Connect with FamilyLuckily, most of our extended family lives close to us, but using a webcam and/or FaceTime has been incredible for keeping the kids connected all the time. As opposed to me having to yell through a crackly phone connection to speak with my grandmother in Korea when I was a kid, my kids can see their grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins whenever they want.\nI Make Play DatesB.I., trying to arrange a group play date usually required back and forth over email, phone calls (what time? where?) and energy spent on the details. Now, when I take the kids out, I send a text to friends with kids \u2013 Going to the park at 1:00 today, maybe will see you there! \u2013 for an easy and quick insta-play date.I Look SmarterYou know that age when kids start asking questions about things you really don\u2019t know the answers to, like: How heavy are clouds? How fast can cheetahs run? Instead of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I can actually find out now by searching the Internet and we can explore the answers to the question together, no matter how obscure.I can\u2019t be totally sure if technology has organized me or if I have organized it, but the kind of organization it provides ensures that I focus less on the tasks at hand and more on spending time with my kids. That definitely makes me a better mom.How has technology made YOU a better parent? Please let us know in the comments below.This post is part of a series on the dilemmas of raising digital kids.

    "scraped_body": "in Too Much DetailYesterday, one of my colleagues asks me to help him to get the \u201cfunctional\u201d solution of a simple programming challenge: the advent of code day 2.Edit: to be clear, that example is obviously overkill (and this is why it is subheaded \u201cin too much detail\u201d), but this is about the journey, not the goal :).I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert in functional programming, but I hope you\u2019ll find interesting to have the different steps and thoughts that have guided me during this refactoring.In this exercise, we have to compute the total surface area needed to wrap boxes (which have different sizes). Knowing the surface of one box is computed by the following formula (from the problem statement):2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l + smallest side surfaceAnd we will assume that our input has already been converted to an arrays list:[ [l, w, h], [l, w, h], \u2026 ]First let\u2019s start with the classic procedural solution:The first thing we notice is the accumulation through the total_surface variable, which is symptomatic of a missing reduce function:Let\u2019s extract each operation to its own function for a better separation of concerns:I don\u2019t really like the sides function because it does three times the same thing. It\u2019s time to replace it with a recursive alternative:Same mixed feelings with the content of the box_surface function, it looks like a reducer is missing:Now we can delete the smallest_side function and put it in box_surface. And in the same time, remove the unnecessary parenthesis:Since sides return an array, and box_surface make a reduction on it. We can extract the reduce instruction from the box_surface function:Ok, but there is something we really love in the functional world: to have only pure expressions (that mean no { } characters to define lambda function\u2019s body).It is not possible here because box_side is used twice at line 9. So, let\u2019s create a simple function apply to handle this:We notice this apply function really looks like an IIFE:At least, we can extract the boxes.reduce function (lines 7\u20138) and replace the box_surface function.Now, we have only simple expressions to compute all the required steps:Compare it with the original procedural code:To be clear, this is not production code nor \u201cbest practice\u201d. This is about solving a simple exercise with the most (to absurdity) functional idioms: only pure expressions and no duplications.Of course, the readability is worst, but the idea was to show the thought process and the techniques involved.",

It was an accusation of absolutely anything, and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense.\nSandemose's novel described working-class life in the fictional town of Jante. He wrote in 1955, a bit mischievously, that \"Many people have recognized [in Jante] their own hometown \u2013 this has happened regularly to people from Arendal [Norway], Troms\u00f8 [Norway] and Viborg [Denmark]\".[6] Sandemose made no claim to having invented the rules; he simply sought to formulate social norms that had stamped the Danish and Norwegian psyches for centuries.\n\nSociological effects[edit]\nAlthough intended as criticism of society in general, some critics in the 1990s argued that the Law of Jante had shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position.[7]\nIt is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish.[citation needed] The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes.[8] It is commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected.[8]\nWhile the original intention was as satire, Kim Orlin Kantardjiev, a Norwegian politician[9] and educational advisor, claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools as more of a social code to encourage group behavior, and attempts to credit it with fueling Nordic countries' high happiness scores.[8] It has also been suggested that contentedness with a humdrum lifestyle is a part of happiness in the Scandinavian countries.[10]\nHowever, in Scandinavia, there have also been journalistic articles which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates.[11] Backlash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.[8]\n\nAppearance in English-language sources[edit]\nWhen interviewed during episode 646 of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, broadcast November 9, 2018, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd explained that although he had recently received an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for a lauded performance, the inhibitions induced by the Law of Jante prevented him from boasting of the accolade.[12]\nIn Wisting, a 2019 Norwegian police procedural television series, partially in English, the character Line says (translated), \"The newspaper sales numbers and the Law of Jante are merging.\"[13]\nIn Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Bourdain and Ren\u00e9 Redzepi discuss Janteloven's effect on Danish culture.[14]\nIn some interviews, Greta Thunberg credits and appreciates the law for her being ignored by Swedes that see her in public.[15][16]\nThis law is prominent in Swedish culture and the Swedish parliament sees it as potentially harmful, holding people back.[17]\n\n\nConformity\nCrab mentality\nDeindividuation\nDiscrimination of excellence\nGroupthink\n\"Harrison Bergeron\"\nHegemony\nLagom\nLeveling mechanism\nLeveling (philosophy)\nMilieu control\nSocial model\nSpiral of silence\nTall poppy syndrome\n\n\n\n\n^ \"Your Guide to Norwegian Culture\". discover-the-world.com.

    "scraped_body": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Friday that the Hyperloop, a futuristic transportation concept involving levitating pods, may be a candidate for research funding from his department.Secretary Foxx\u2019s said the money could come from his department\u2019s University Transportation Centers program for research into new ways of getting around. That program gives grants to over 30 research centers nationwide totaling up to $72.5 million annually.Foxx\u2019s comments, made at the SpaceX Hyperloop Design Weekend in College Station, Tex., got a warm reception at the event, a conference and competition for college students working on Hyperloop prototypes. The Hyperloop, as outlined in a 2013 paper by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, would transport passengers or freight in pods levitating through a low-pressure, tube-like track at up to 700 miles per hour. Musk has described it as a \u201ccross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table.\u201d Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\u201cThis is a special moment in transportation,\u201d Foxx said to hearty applause. \u201cWe weren\u2019t around when the airplane was invented. We weren\u2019t around when the wheel was invented.\u201dBut, shortly after comparing a still very speculative idea with the advent of the wheel, Foxx brought the audience back to earth about the still unrealized Hyperloop dream. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research that still needs to be done. It\u2019ll be a while before we see something like this on the ground.\u201dIn fact, Foxx admitted that he had been a Hyperloop skeptic. \u201cWhen I first heard about the Hyperloop, I was less than enthusiastic. I had a lot of reservations,\u201d he said.But Foxx came around to a more upbeat viewpoint\u2014not necessarily because he had been sold on the Hyperloop itself, but because of a more general desire to promote innovation. \u201cGovernment must resist the urge to reflexively say no,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to play a constructive role in embracing new technologies.\u201dThe Department of Transportation and the Obama administration have recently put that sentiment into action with $4 billion in funding for self-driving car research.But despite Foxx\u2019s enthusiasm, the potential pool of federal funding for Hyperloop technologies is relatively small. Hyperloop Tech, one of the startups trying to build a working Hyperloop system, has already raised around $80 million from private sources.For more on the Hyperloop, watch our video. Foxx went on to draw attention to more immediate solutions to mounting strains on the U.S. transportation system, including the need to shift away from a current system he described as \u201croad dependent\u201d toward something more diverse.\u201cTransportation choice has to be part of the future.\u201d",

    "scraped_body": "By now you\u2019ve surely heard that moving forward, every company will be a software company, and that shift is happening now as companies large and small scramble to transform into digitally-driven organizations.\nWherever you turn, businesses\u00a0are facing tremendous disruptive pressure. What\u2019s interesting is that the theory about how firms\u00a0should be dealing with this massive change is itself in flux, transforming if you will, as organizations\u00a0come to grips with the idea that the most basic ways they do business are being called into question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust\u00a0over a year\u00a0ago when I researched this topic, I found that the general method for\u00a0dealing with disruption was developing\u00a0pockets of innovation inside a company\u00a0using labs or incubators to prime the innovation pump.\u00a0Today, when I explore the same issues, I\u2019m finding that\u00a0companies are taking a much more comprehensive approach that has to do with reviewing\u00a0every department and business process in the organization.\nThe issue\u00a0with the lab or incubator concept\u00a0is how you\u00a0move the\u00a0kind of innovative thinking from that internal innovation test bed into the organization at large. The reasoning behind isolating innovation was\u00a0sound enough, because those fledgling ideas would very likely be sucked up into the vacuum of existing business policies where they\u00a0get lost forever in a haze of bureaucratic negativity. If you want to kill innovation, you just keep saying \u201cno.\u201d\nThe new thinking says you have to start looking at the big picture from the first day and you have to consider the impact that these changes are going to have on the entire organization. You have to figure out how to grease the skids of creativity\u00a0so they don\u2019t get slowed down by HR, legal, IT and by all the systems and departments that have been put in place to protect and limit these kinds of changes inside large organizations. Now the idea is to teach those well-meaning naysayers to get the heck out of the way and for them\u00a0to also find new ways of achieving their goals and requirements as the organization marches forward into a digitally driven future.\nThinking Bigger Picture\nAs we\u2019ve seen through the experience of\u00a0implementing individual enterprise\u00a0systems such as content management, ERP or CRM trying to get a large organization moving in the same direction across departments is a huge challenge. When you suddenly put\u00a0your whole business model on notice, a pocket of innovation is just too incremental to deal with that scale of change.\nAaron Levie, CEO at Box is co-teaching a course this semester at Stanford with professor Rob Siegel called The\u00a0Industrialist\u2019s Dilemma\u00a0where they explore the kinds of issues large established organizations face as they maneuver through these\u00a0massive changes.\n\u201cWhat happens when you take a business that\u2019s good at analog stores, and software can deliver new disruptive experiences? How do they respond? No product is more physical and analog than a retail store or car. We are seeing those [delivery models] inverted and flipped over by technology,\u201d says Levie.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat happens when you take a business that\u2019s good at analog stores, and software can deliver new disruptive experiences? How do they respond?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAaron Levie\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhen I spoke to Edward Hiaett, SVP of services at Pivotal and in charge of Pivotal Labs, at Web Summit in October, 2014, his company\u00a0was one of those organizations working on the pockets of innovation approach, but he said his company\u2019s thinking has evolved.\nWhen he looks at a firm\u00a0like one of his clients, Ford, he sees a company that has to completely change the way it does business. In the next decade it\u2019s possible that many people won\u2019t own cars in the traditional sense. In fact\u00a0they might not even be driving them anymore as self-driven cars become more widespread. That means the whole firm\u00a0has\u00a0to start examining all of its long-established systems around\u00a0how they design, deliver, market and sell automobiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they need to start looking at these systems now before the delivery\u00a0model changes, Hiaett says. It doesn\u2019t mean it changes all at once, but if Ford is in the midst of pivoting\u00a0from a business selling cars\u00a0to one that\u2019s in the\u00a0\u00a0\u2018the mobility business\u2019, it\u2019s clearly going to have a major\u00a0impact on all of the company\u2019s long-established business processes.\nClarity Of Vision\nThis means that the executive suite has to have a clear\u00a0plan for\u00a0the future, and a way to\u00a0put\u00a0the company on the road toward delivering on that vision.\u00a0They can\u2019t hide the innovation team in the basement. They need to inject innovative thinking into every process in the organization and that requires reconsidering every process, says Michael Krigsman, founder of cxotalk.com, a weekly web-based talk show on which Krigsman\u00a0interviews leading tech industry executives.\n\u201cThe successful executives\u00a0are able to embrace change. This is a very key point and it\u2019s really the most difficult thing about this. With the exception of startups, every company has an established business model and way they do business. Product lines, services and employees have been optimized for standard processes,\u201d Krigsman told TechCrunch.\nExecutives require a particular set of skills and approaches as\u00a0the organization shifts:\n\nLevie says that he sees CIOs with these kinds of traits in his job as Box CEO, but he says he has seen organizations held back when\u00a0there isn\u2019t a unified front in\u00a0the C suite.\n\u201cI think the majority of companies recognize how disruptive these trends are. A small percentage recognize this at the CEO level and board level. Me personally in building and selling enterprise software, we interact with a large percentage of CIOs that get it, but don\u2019t always have the support from CEO and that makes it harder without top-down support,\u201d Levie explained.\nIt\u2019s A People Problem\nAs we tend to do in this business, we have been attacking this type of change by throwing different technologies at it, and while technology can certainly help, it requires a much more personal approach by management, one that takes the people who have to implement these massive changes into account.\nPhoto by cartoonresource on Shutterstock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust last\u00a0week Accenture released its annual 2016 Technology Vision Report\u00a0and the consulting juggernaut says the success of any company going through fundamental digital transformation is understanding that it\u2019s first and foremost a people issue.\nFinding ways to help people across\u00a0this digital divide and the culture shock that rapid change brings is going to be just as important as the technology we use to get there, says Marc Carrel-Billiard, global tech R&D Lead on digital transformation at Accenture.\n\u201cWhen we talk to clients, we usually start by\u00a0talking about technology, but [typically] after 15 minutes, we shift gears. We start talking\u00a0about people and the digital culture shock they are in. If [clients]\u00a0want to be digital, it\u2019s\u00a0not just about technological change\u00a0because it\u2019s coming [regardless]. Companies\u00a0need to think about people or it will not work at all,\u201d he said.\nHow To Get There\nOne lesson we should have learned after all these years of trying to implement incremental change management is that it\u2019s always been about people and managing how to deal with these changes. Today, the speed of change is coming so quickly, and the requirements are so daunting, that it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed.\u00a0It requires companies to shift their mindset completely, Krigsman says.\n\u201cCompanies that do this well are able to\u00a0adopt a beginner\u2019s mind set, taking an approach of looking at things from a fresh perspective,\u201d he explained.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCompanies that do this well are able to adopt a beginner\u2019s mind set, taking an approach of looking at things from a fresh perspective\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Krigsman, founder CXOTalk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThis could involve, for example, having fewer impediments for customer service by implementing systems so that\u00a0information flows more seamlessly from one department\u00a0to another and across systems.\n\u201cWhat does that mean to customers and internal processes? It comes down to being willing to experiment and look at things through a new lens,\u201d Krigsman said.\nIn fact, he recommends that companies partner with startups, which tend to be smaller, more nimble and creative. \u201cThe reason for that, the big challenge is how do you inject new thinking. And that\u2019s a very hard thing to do because it comes down to several things, the ingrained behaviors of people who have been doing this job this way for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy injecting\u00a0new thinking into a company, employees can start to see that there are different\u00a0ways to handle\u00a0those\u00a0standard business practices and can begin to incorporate\u00a0that\u00a0type of creative thinking\u00a0into their organizational philosophy.\nWhen you consider that 88 percent of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 are now gone, it\u2019s not hard to see that change has always been with us, but the rate of change is accelerating dramatically due in large part to the disruption brought about by digital transformation.\n\u201cThe cool thing is that incumbents recognize that the same assets that can hold them back, can also be used to compete in a different guise,\u201d Levie said. That means it\u2019s not all gloom and doom, companies\u00a0just have to start thinking much more creatively about their\u00a0digital future and the effect that will have across the\u00a0organization.\n",

People trying to unbundle Craigslist do so with modern UX, but Yelp is a modern company with modern UX, and the people unbundling it, mostly, use constraint. Instead of offering 500 or 1000 restaurants and a search box, they give you a list - 50, or 10, or even 1. Sometimes this is deliberate and sometimes it flows from the business model, but the result is the same - they remove the 'tyranny of choice'. I don't want 500 options for restaurants, all of which I'd like - I want five.You can see much the same thing in fashion. Now that the flash sales model has receded somewhat, the strategy for a lot of online fashion and luxury goods offerings is, again, constraint - curation, or, one could say, a list. Show me 10 bags, not every SKU currently under production in the entire global apparel industry.Showing every SKU, of course, is exactly the Amazon approach - 'the everything store' - and it works well for some categories, and especially when you know exactly what you want. But knowing what you want is not necessarily the starting point - that's what needs to happen along the funnel. Amazon's relative weakness at curation, discovery and recommendation (I've seen data suggesting the recommendation platform is only 1/4 of its books sales) is, I think, a big reason why, after 25 years of ruthless and relentless execution, it's still only got to 25% of the print books market in the UK and USA. A bookshop (or any shop) is, yes, the end-point to a logistics system, but a good bookshop is primarily a discovery platform. That is, it's more about the tables than the shelves. And the tables are lists, not inventory.\u00a0The problem with using a list instead of a searchable database is how you get to scale, or perhaps, what kind of scale you can have. So, Yahoo's hierarchical directory (a list of lists) got to 3.2m entries before collapsing under its own weight - it was too big to be browsed, and reached the point that only search made sense (and Google did better search). But if the list is shorter (that is, more aggressively curated as opposed to just compiled and catalogued), then who's doing the curation, and more importantly, how do you find the list in the first place?\u00a0\nAll curation grows until it requires search. All search grows until it requires curation.\u2014 Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) December 18, 2015\n\n  Hence, I always thought the most appealing part of Flipboard was the manually curated directory of sites to follow. It's a list of lists, but it isn't trying to encompass everything, and so, unlike Yahoo, it isn't unmanageably big. But that just relocates the problem - what if you want a list that isn't on the list of lists? If you wanted to find 5 new sites to read about a topic you care about - ice-climbing, or vintage furniture, or experimental electronic music, or children's picture books - where would you find it? Can you create a platform for all those lists without turning into Yahoo?\u00a0And it's worth remembering that Google hasn't actually solved this either - it might give you one blog post, but not a list of 20 sites to try. (Indeed, one could suggest that blogs themselves break Google in some sense - you're looking for a stream, but Google can only give you the post.)\u00a0Apple Music and Spotify both have an angle on this; they both make the observation that 30m tracks and a search engine is a poor experience, and that you need some form of filter, based in some way on your preferences, but ultimately arbitrary all the same.\u00a0 Apple's model in particular is interesting because it's a hybrid - it uses automation to match manually curated playlists (again, lists) with (mostly) algorithmically-determined tastes. So the list is made by hand, but the machine finds the list for you.\u00a0Equally, with Facebook, you make your friends list by hand, and you and your friends share things into that pool manually, but the Facebook algorithm automatically suggests stories for you from that pool - again, a hybrid. Indeed, one could suggest that you don't actually need to know any of those people for the system to work - 'these are things that people in a sample of 300 people in your rough socio-economic demographic clicked on'.Something that sits in the back of my mind when thinking about this is that department stores and supermarkets, the Amazons of their days, didn't kill small retail. They were not winner-takes-all models. They did kill people who couldn't match their service, selection and price, and were simply end-points to a logistics chain out-competed by a more efficient end-point. But one thing I saw growing up in South London in the 1980s as supermarkets deployed was that small food shops tended to disappear, and then re-appear in new incarnations, providing service, curation and selection that supermarkets themselves couldn't match, for people willing to search them out and of course pay the premium, and where there was the density to support this. They didn't scale - they didn't turn into chains of 30 artisanal butchers - but they often prospered. One saw something similar with bookshops: Waterstones put many out of business, but many also got created (just before Amazon took 25% off the top of the market, of course).\u00a0This in turn reminds me of a story in the New York Times, many years ago, about small Japanese shops who wanted only word-of-mouth customers and so made themselves hard to find (even by Japanese standards). In particular, there was one denim shop in a back-alley of Tokyo called 'Not Found' - so as to be ungooglable. One can call this curation, or hipsterdom, or just a Veblen good. But in the past, such things were always geographically constrained - you had to live in a big city (while chain retail took homogenized versions of the same thing to everyone). I wonder, as ecommerce matures, how much will be carved out into exactly the kind of spectrum of large and small retail beyond the big aggregators, and how far this removal of geographic constraint might make it easier rather than harder for them to take sales from the giants, in part by removing that density problem. That is, there might be a lot more lists, they might be hard to find, and not be part of some global aggregator, and that might be OK.\u00a0\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n              \n            \n          \n\n        ",

    "scraped_body": "\nIn this previous post about Safepoints I claimed that this here piece of code:\n\nWill get your JVM to hang and will not exit after 5 seconds, as one might expect from reading the code. The reason this happens, I claimed, is because the compiler considers for loops limited by an int to be counted, and will therefore not insert a safepoint poll into the generated assembly code. This was the theory, and I tested it, and it definitely hung on my machine ('It Works On My Machine'\u2122).\nTo my great surprise, some people not only read the posts, they also run the code (it's like they don't trust me ;-) ). And 2 of those diligent readers got back to me in the comments saying that actually the JVM exists just fine. So I ran it again, and it hung, again. Then I ran it with different versions of the JVM, and it hung as I expected. Then I thought, maybe they are running the code I put on GitHub, so I tried that. That also hung when I ran it from Eclipse, but did not when I built it with Maven and ran it from the command line. EUREKA!\nAs it happens, Eclipse has it's own Java compiler (a fact well known to those who know it well, no doubt) and the bytecode it generated (the .class file) hung every time, but Maven uses javac and the .class file generated from that did not hang. When testing initially I was running my class inside Eclipse, or using the Eclipse .class file to run from the command line. Both .class files are valid, but different (same-same but different). We can use javap to print out class bytecode and compare (\"javap -c -v -p <class file>\"). For your pleasure you can find the original Java file, the 2 class files and their respective bytecode printouts on GitHub and come to your own conclusions before you continue reading.\nSo... is my understanding (and the Eclipse javac) somehow out of date? can this problem of telling counted loops from uncounted loops be solved by the bytecode compiler?\nHow is the bytecode different?\nWell, mostly not that different:\nAn easy to spot difference which we can tell is semantically the same is the bytecode result for \"System.out.println(\"How Odd:\" + l);\" you'll notice that Eclipse is using the constructor \"java/lang/StringBuilder.\"<init>\":(Ljava/lang/String;)\" while javac is opting for \"java/lang/StringBuilder.\"<init>\":()V\" followed by an append. Semantically the 2 choices are the same. We create a StringBuilder and append the String \"How odd:\" and the variable l. The reality is that there are subtle differences, the Eclipse version will allocate a larger char[]\u00a0for instance. It may also be that the Eclipse pattern will miss out on some String concatenation optimization because the OpenJDK implementers are\u00a0likely to focus on patterns generated from the official javac.\nThe loop interpretation is different. Eclipse is checking the loop conditions at the end of the loop whereas javac is building a loop with the checks upfront and the loop backedge at the end. That seems like the important difference.\n\nLet's zoom in on the relevant bytecode for the loop:\n\nIf we were to reverse translate the loop bytecode to ugly Java (which supported goto) we'd get:\n\nNote that there's no special Java bytecode for loop control flows. So why so different at runtime? If we dump out the assembly for the run method we will see that the Eclipse version is missing the safepoint in the loop (the method has a {poll_return}\u00a0but there's no {poll}), and the javac version has that safepoint there. Is it the bytecode difference that makes this happen?\nVariations on bytecode\n\nI tinkered with the class a bit and refactored the loop out of the lambda. This results in similar bytecode for the loop and same behaviour. I then made the limit of the loop a parameter of the method, this time it behaved like the javac version, but had the same funky loop structure:\n\nWTF? if this is a purely a bytecode subtlety then it's seems pretty weird. What sort of flaky compiler would swing like this?\n\nThe compiler did it?\n\nBut... which compiler? so we looked at the above bytecode compiler results, this is but the first of many compilers to process your code on it's way to being executed. Traditionally when discussing Java code compilation we look at the following stages:\nJavac: From code to bytecode\nInterpreter: Step through the bytecode\nC1/Client: Short compilation time, does not generate the best optimized code. Intended for short lived applications.\nC2/Server: Longer compilation time, better optimized code. Intended for long running applications.\n\nAnd the compilation timeline would look something like this:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/->C1\n*.java->javac->*.class->interpreter->class+profile<\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\->C2\nThe situation with OpenJDK8 is more complex with Tiered Compilation allowing us a smooth transition from interpreter to C2 compilation via C1 compilations.\u00a0\nGiven the behaviour we are after was supposed to manifest after a C1/C2 compilation we can run the code above to find which compiler compiled the method in question by adding the flag: -XX:+PrintCompilation:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 159 \u00a0201 % \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ 13 (44 bytes)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 159 \u00a0202 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds (44 bytes)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 159 \u00a0203 % \u00a0 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ 13 (44 bytes)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 162 \u00a0201 % \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ -2 (44 bytes) \u00a0 made not entrant\n\u00a0 \u00a0 142 \u00a0200 % \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ -2 (44 bytes) \u00a0 made not entrant\n\u00a0 \u00a01896 \u00a0202 % \u00a0 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ -2 (44 bytes) \u00a0 made not entrant\n\u00a0 \u00a01896 \u00a0203 % \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ 13 (44 bytes)\n\u00a0 \u00a01896 \u00a0204 % \u00a0 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ 13 (44 bytes)\n\u00a0 \u00a01899 \u00a0203 % \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safepoint.hang.WhenWillItExitInt2::countOdds @ -2 (44 bytes) \u00a0 made not entrant\nThe 3/4 printouts on the 4th column above indicate the method is compiled by C1 (profiled) and C2. But what is that % about? This is an indicator that the compilations are not 'normal' compilations but rather On Stack Replacement(OSR) compilations. OSR compilations are 'special', from the OpenJDK glossary:\non-stack replacement \nAlso known as 'OSR'. The process of converting an interpreted (or less optimized) stack frame into a compiled (or more optimized) stack frame. This happens when the interpreter discovers that a method is looping, requests the compiler to generate a special nmethod with an entry point somewhere in the loop (specifically, at a backward branch), and transfers control to that nmethod. A rough inverse to deoptimization.\nI like the \"rough inverse to deoptimization\", it's a great mental qualification helper. OSR is the opposite of deoptimization because it is a mid-method replacement of code with compiled code, whereas a deoptimization is a mid-method replacement of code with interpreted code. Normal compilation unit replacements happen out of method, so while the method is off stack. OSR is specifically done to replace long running loops, like our countOdds method. As we can see from the printout above both C1 and C2 can produce OSR compilations.\nIt is impossible to disable OSR directly in a product build (there's a developer option -XX:-CICompileOSR), but we can force upfront compilation by using the following flags: \"-XX:-TieredCompilation -server/client -Xcomp\". Running with these arguments all 3 variations (original, refactored loop, refactored parametrized loop) now hang both for the Eclipse and the javac generated bytecode.\nIn both cases where the Eclipse versions hang we can see OSR compilations of the relevant code.\nSo it seems:\nC1/C2 non-OSR compilations of the loop treat it as a counted loop, thus eliminating the safepoint poll and demonstrating the hung behaviour due to huge TTSP.\nC1/C2 OSR compilations of the same code result in different results depending on the generated bytecode for the loop. I'm not going to dig further into the reasons, but I would welcome any feedback from OpenJDK compiler guys.\n\nThe OSR compilation decision to treat the loop as non-counted is quite reasonable. If we have a loop which remains on stack for very long periods we should perhaps consider it uncounted.\nKiller Task\n\n\nI started down this path looking for valid Java code which will result in a hung JVM due to huge TTSP. Since OSR got in the way, can we build such a task? Sure we can, we just need to warmup the loop until it is C2 compiled and then run it with a large limit, like so:\n\n\nThis fucker now hangs in both the Eclipse and javac versions. Joy!\nSide note: OSR and JMH\n\n\nI look at benchmarks people write quite a bit, and it is very common to see people rolling their own benchmark harnesses put their \"code under measurement\" in a counted loop, run it 100,000 times and derive their results. Often that means the code they are measuring is OSR compiled code, which is different (for better or worse, mostly worse) from the code they will be running normally. If you are one of these people, I beg you: cut that fucking shit out!\n\nJUST USE JMH!\nPLEASE?\n\nTo a large extent it will cover your use case. Where it doesn't cover your use case, post a question on jmh-dev mailing list, it might be that you've missed something. If it turns out JMH cannot cover your usecase, make sure you've read the JMH samples before rolling your own harness.\nI'm not going to include a before and after example, because it just makes me sad. Look at SO for some fine examples.\n\nCounted Loops?\nI keep saying 'counted loops' like it means something, so here are some examples for you to play with and contemplate:\n\nSo, as you can see the definition ain't so clear and I would imagine some of the above behaviour will vary depending on JVM version/vendor/phase of the moon etc.\nSummary\n\nSo, it seems my previous example was not as tested as it should have been. I apologize to anyone who has based life changing decisions on that sample. I hope this post helps in explaining away the subtleties which led to my downfall.\n\nThe above examples help demonstrate that the line between counted and uncounted loops is a tad confusing and the classification may depend on differences in bytecode, compiler mode, and so on.\n\n\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n                  Although hesitant to jump on the \u201cdeep learning bandwagon,\u201d student Theodore DeRego decided to spend his winter break trying to learn more about his newly found guilty pleasure. The result is a framework he calls deeplearn-rs, which can be used to build trainable matrix computation graphs that are configurable at runtime.\nAfter gaining an understanding of deep learning, DeRego sat down to experiment with real data and build real networks. He wrote that this was the first time he carried out a full deep learning experiment with a modern framework.\n(Related: Microsoft releases a deep learning toolkit)\nDeRego\u2019s project involved both deep learning and systems programming, and he developed a deep learning framework in Rust that uses OpenCL to \u201cdo all the heavy lifting,\u201d he wrote. His OpenCL matrix math library can be found here.\nFor those who don\u2019t know about deep learning and computation graphs, DeRego broke it down. He said that artificial neural networks can be represented in a more general framework, which is computation graphs. Artificial neural networks can be represented by compact graphs of matrix operations as well.\n\u201cFully connected layers use matrix multiplication to multiply the weights and inputs and sum the products for each node,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor each layer, all the inputs are represented as one matrix and all the weights are represented as another. So convenient!\u201d\nThis makes it easy to implement fast deep neural networks by running the matrix operations on highly parallel GPUs, according to DeRego.\nHe said that Rust has strict ownership and borrowing rules, which means \u201cYou can\u2019t just dole out pointers to things like you can in most other languages.\u201d Instead, he used indices into arrays.\nDeRego said the most interesting function here is Graph::add_node. Give the function an operation and a list of inputs, and \u201cIt\u2019ll handle the rest,\u201d he said. It creates the output variables and a new gradient for each of the inputs.\nDeRego started working on this project a week ago, and he is \u201cpretty satisfied\u201d with how far it\u2019s come.\nMoving forward, he would like to implement some loss functions, train a fuzzy xor network, and automate the training process with multiple trainers.\n\u201cYou can construct and (manually) train a deep computation graph, and it all runs on the GPU via OpenCL,\u201d wrote DeRego.\ndeeplearn-rs can be found on GitHub here.\n              \n                                        \n                    \n                        About Madison Moore\n                        \n                            Madison Moore is an Online and Social Media Editor for SD Times.

    "scraped_body": "Dear Bitcoin Community,I apologize I have been silent for such a long time. \u00a0Current events and business pressures have kept me busy, as well as in an opaque cloud of uncertainty about Armory's future. \u00a0I had looked forward to coming back to share with you good news and a fresh outlook, but unfortunately that's not the position that I am in. \u00a0 I could probably write a book about the depth and complexity of events of the past year, the lessons I've learned and the personalities I've dealth with. \u00a0However, at this point it's all history, and I've always been more interested in planning the future than dwelling too much on the past. \u00a0Ultimately, Armory as a business was not managed well. \u00a0We didn't raise money when we should have, and the Bitcoin space was not ready for the tech we produced (rather, the business economics didn't match up, yet). \u00a0There hasn't been much public activity from us, because we were primarily focused on building a suite of enterprise security tools out of public view. \u00a0These tools were impressive, but most of our target market was still in the exploratory phase and interested in proof-of-concepts, not actually holding $500M. \u00a0Not yet. \u00a0We couldn't make up for our missed opportunities to raise money to keep moving towards our vision.Along the way, we accumulated a mess of legal and corporate complexity that has made it difficult to do anything constructive with Armory's intellectual property. \u00a0These complexities make it risky for me to continue development, even if the money was there to pay me a salary. \u00a0It has also made it difficult to be acquired by another company that shares my vision, that could provide funding to see its execution. \u00a0In the short-term, this is the end of the road for my involvement in Armory. \u00a0My only real choice is to move on, and try to contribute my expertise elsewhere. \u00a0After spending 80% of the last year primarily dealing with business operations, I welcome a return to the life of being a software guru, which is where my skill really lies. \u00a0I also want to thank the other developers who were so loyal that they stuck around through missed payrolls way longer than any \"regular employee\" would. \u00a0I'm proud that I was able to build and maintain such a loyal and devoted team to our mission.In immediate future, Farhod (goatpig) has indicated that he will take over the reigns of the public side of the Armory project. \u00a0He also has my utmost confidence and trust, and demonstrated a selfless passion for growing Armory for the sake of the Bitcoin community. \u00a0Armory may be revived in the future, but in the short-term the rest of team has to move on without it.I want to take this time to thank the community, which has been instrumental in getting us even this far. \u00a0Even in its current state, the public version of Armory is a powerful, unique, and much needed piece of software which I think has made a significant impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem. \u00a0And a large part of that is due to the testing, feedback, discussion and promotion provided by the community over the years. \u00a0I hope to continue my involvement in some way and help the Bitcoin ecosystem grow in the future.Alan Reiner",

    "scraped_body": "Bruno Senna prepares for a showdown against gamers\u00a9 Formula ELast summer, a Bundesliga football team from a small German town in Lower Saxony made signing history. Among the other high profile signings to VfL Wolfsburg FC during a turbulent off-season transfer window, was a name completely unknown to pundits; Benedikt 'SaLz0r' Saltzer. Saltzer was not a rookie, fresh from the academies, nor was he scouted at a local park. For the first time in professional football, the team took on a player who would not kick a single ball in his career with the club.The 23-year-old, instead, represents The Wolves on virtual soil, as the first player in their FIFA 16 eSports division. And, as of last week, Wolfsburg have also acquired David 'DaveBtw' Bytheway, runner-up at 2014\u2019s FIFA Interactive World Cup. The runners-up of last year\u2019s Bundesliga are the first to jump into a widening niche in the sportsgaming sphere, one of combining the traditional competitions games are inspired by with tournaments of their own. The eSports-sports singularity is approaching.Elsewhere last week, in a converted cinema screen in London\u2019s Fulham Broadway, two racing legends were being lapped by a British teenager. The inaugural Formula E Race Off invited the public to try their hand in a showdown against Bruno Senna and Nico Prost in Forza 6, held at the Gfinity Arena. Despite having a combined 20 years of professional racing experience between them, the two were battling for last place in a field of six other young drivers.Their jobs aren\u2019t immediately at risk, though, as the skills required to drive a machine around these same tracks are slightly different to moving a joystick. Bruno, nephew of three-time Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna, believes the sensory deprivation of on-screen simulator racing are good for some skills, but not others.\u201cWhat you are doing when you\u2019re driving in the simulator is you are training your eye, and you can never react as fast through what your eye sees than what you feel with your body,\u201d said Senna. \u201cWe are clearly getting to the point where you can learn a racetrack by playing a video game, but in terms of car, the cars are very difficult to simulate. It will need some more time in the virtual garage to tweak the setup and get the car feeling more like the real thing.\u201dThe relative difference in this sort of training showed as Zak Scholes, an avid teenage fan of motorsports, took the top spot on the podium ahead of Senna and Prost. He also managed to hold off Nissan GT Academy alumnus Jann Mardenborough, who has gone onto a successful early career in motorsports after winning a similar eSports competition on Gran Turismo in 2011.As a route into professional racing, there isn\u2019t much better experience than this sort of competition. The accuracy of simulation racers to their real-world tracks makes them powerful tools for testing the theoretical skills of new drivers.\u2018\u2019Definitely track knowledge makes a difference, if you know how the flow of the track works you can really understand how to do it faster,\u201d Senna said. \u201cOf course in the game, some of the limits are different and you can try different things, but you can get to at least 85 percent [required knowledge] easily. Similar to when we come out of the simulators before going on the track.\u201dBenedikt \u2018SaLz0r\u2019 Saltzer in his team\u2019s jersey\u00a9 Wolfsburg FCTaking lessons learned from one form of competition out of the virtual world into physical pursuits isn\u2019t unique to racing, though is extremely welcome in a sport as fraught with safety concerns. Saltzer believes his time playing and studying movement off-pitch in the FIFA games will help him with his on-pitch endeavours as a striker in the German seventh division.\u201cA computer\u2019s artificial intelligence makes practically no mistakes if you set it up correctly,\u201d he said to FIFA.com. \u201cDefenders move phenomenally well and really close down the space. With this in mind, real footballers could analyse a FIFA match to see how its defensive players move.\u201dThese possibilities blur the line between two traditionally opposite past-times. Whether it\u2019s offering new career routes to players, or another way for the growing Formula E fan-base or the two million who entered FIFA\u2019s FIWC qualifiers to get involved in their sports, eSports is spanning that gap.\u201cFIFA is getting more realistic with each passing year and is also very popular with our fans,\u201d the club\u2019s general manager Klaus Allofs told FIFA.com. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching young supporters in particular with eSports, and we\u2019re delighted about that. We want to use our ever increasing commitment in this area to bring these two worlds even closer together in future.\u201d",

    "scraped_body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen I first read Reinventing Organizations, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux\u2019s excellent study of open culture organisations around the world, I remember being moved and puzzled by the tale of AES. AES was (still is, I think)\u00a0a publicly listed energy company that pioneered many of the concepts of open culture in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Then something went wrong: Enron. The stock market slid, and AES\u2019s shareholders demanded that AES go back to more traditional management practices to fix this (even though it was\u00a0obvious that AES\u2019s stock decrease was environmental \u2013 the whole energy market was collapsing because of Enron\u2019s speculation and (ahem) hard-edged \u201ctraditional management\u201d practices).\nThen I read Joy At Work, which was written by Dennis Bakke, one of the founders of AES and the main source of the pioneering culture work at AES. It\u2019s a truly excellent book filled with useful ideas that we\u2019ve applied at GrantTree, not the least of which is the definition of Advice Process which we use to make all decisions.\u00a0And it is also a very bitter book.\nBuilding open cultures is very hard work. It digs deep inside of us. It changes us. Like the Southern Oracle\u2019s second, mirrored gate, it\u00a0requires us\u00a0to face all sorts of internal insecurities that we\u00a0would normally ignore \u2013 things deeply specific to us\u00a0and which are often very uncomfortable to deal with. Most people go their whole life without really facing themselves. Those who would\u00a0create open culture organisations spend most of their time doing it, a rewarding but difficult habit.\nIf it is uncomfortable to face our\u00a0shadows, it is doubly so to encourage others to face their own. It\u2019s dangerous work too.\u00a0Human change often requires dissolving what was there to build it anew, but when\u00a0people are undergoing the first part of change, the dissolution, it feels like things they could once rely on are no longer there. They are afraid. They sometimes blame us\u00a0for \u201cmaking\u201d them go through this. When you\u00a0care deeply about every relationship (and to build an open culture, you must care), it is incredibly hard to\u00a0go through this process with others too, always facing the risk that\u00a0one of those people will\u00a0refuse to change, blame you for it, and so attack you as the source of their suffering.\nPart of what sustains me\u00a0(and, I guess, other open culture advocates) while dealing with all this is the fundamental belief that what I\u2019m doing is making a positive, lasting difference to those it touches, the belief that this way of working is truly better for all who experience it and that we all benefit\u00a0from it.\nI can only imagine what it must be like to spend decades building such a culture, only to have it wrenched from you, changed and corrupted back into a\u00a0closed, hierarchical culture. The word \u201cgutting\u201d comes to mind. I am certainly not surprised that Dennis Bakke is bitter. It\u2019s hard to see your life\u2019s work defiled in this way.\nI have previously linked to an excellent article about GitHub\u2019s open culture. Today I\u00a0read something far less inspiring, here:\nCofounder CEO Chris Wanstrath, with support from the board, is radically changing the company\u2019s culture: Out with flat org structure based purely on meritocracy, in with supervisors and middle managers. This has ticked off many people in the old guard.\nIts once famous remote-employee culture has been rolled back. Senior managers are no longer allowed to live afar and must report to the office. This was one reason why some senior execs departed or were asked to leave, one person close to the company told us.\nSome longer-term employees feel like there\u2019s a \u201cculture of fear\u201d where people who don\u2019t support all the changes are being ousted.\nThese are all very clear signs of an open culture that\u2019s being ripped to shreds. It\u2019s tragic.\nIt\u2019s also terribly ironic to see the old bullshit excuse that \u201cwell, it just doesn\u2019t work at this scale\u201d being deployed:\n\u201cThere was a remote culture and very little hierarchical structure which worked wonderfully when they were 30 and 50 people, but at 500, it doesn\u2019t work. Chris has decided that the leadership team needs to be in the building and managing, so remote is not an option for senior executives.\u201d\nAES had 40\u2019000 employees all around the world and yet was successfully open. MorningStarCo has many hundreds. Valve (assuming it\u2019s still open) has thousands. Semco \u2013 who knows, it\u2019s now fragmented into a bunch of open culture companies and likely numbers in the thousands too. Yes, growth is hard. Things change when you grow. But transparency, trust, power and freedom don\u2019t have to be among them.\nTom Preston-Werner\u2019s dream\nWhen did this start? When did the dream start dying? Who knows. But I have a hunch that it started before Tom Preston-Werner was ousted from the company, a couple of years ago, in a case of sexual harassment that was later dismissed as groundless. This smacks me of\u00a0political play, a\u00a0scenario very similar to what played out at AES, where an unrelated incident is used by those who don\u2019t yet understand or trust\u00a0open culture to weaken, attack or destroy it.\u00a0GitHub was an open culture at the time. What did Tom do there? Why was it important to\u00a0get him out?\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laloux addresses the role of the \u201cleader\u201d in an open (also known as\u00a0Teal), non-hierarchical organisation:\nYou might have noticed a major paradox: CEOs are both much less and much more important in self-managing organizations compared to traditional ones. They have given up their top-down hierarchical power. The lines of the pyramid no longer converge towards them. They can no longer make or overturn any decision. And yet, in a time when people still think about organizations in Amber, Orange and Green ways, the CEO has an absolutely critical role in creating and holding a Teal organizational space. But beyond creating and holding that space, paradoxically, there is not much a CEO needs to do; he can let the self-organizing, emerging nature of Evolutionary-Teal take over.\n[\u2026]\nTeal operating principles run deeply against the grain of accepted management thinking, and so a critical role of the founder/CEO is to hold the space for Teal structures and practices. Whenever a problem comes up, someone, somewhere, will call for tried-and-proven solutions:\u00a0let\u2019s add a rule, a control system; let\u2019s put the issue under some centralized function; let\u2019s add a layer of supervision; let\u2019s make processes more prescriptive; let\u2019s make such decisions at a higher level in the future. The calls can come from different corners \u2013 one time it\u2019s a board member who will call for more control, another time a colleague, a supplier or a client. Over and over again, the CEO must ensure that trust prevails and that traditional management practices don\u2019t creep in through the back door.\nAnd so it was with GitHub. Unfortunately, it is through the effect of his absence that we now know for sure that Tom was the leader who was \u201cholding the space\u201d at GitHub. In a way, I guess Tom was outmanoeuvred by someone who thought they knew better what GitHub\u2019s culture\u00a0should be. Whoever this someone is (probably not Chris Wanstrath), they took advantage of the situation and cleared the space for more \u201creasonable\u201d, \u201cgrown-up\u201d management to be put in. And so GitHub\u2019s once open, innovating, amazing, world-leading culture is being replaced to create another\u00a0workplace just like every other closed workplace.\nRather than analyse the causes of all this (I don\u2019t know enough to do so anyway), I\u2019d like to conclude the article by thanking Tom Preston-Werner. While it was open, GitHub was an inspiration that I (and no doubt many others) drew from to help open up\u00a0the culture of our own companies. I have no idea what Tom is planning to do next \u2013 he\u2019s still very young, I\u2019m hopeful! \u2013 but I hope that he will be able to move past this failure, as tragic as it might be, and build another, even more amazing open culture company.\nThank you Tom. Best of luck with the next venture!\nPS: Oh, by the way, if you\u2019re a developer at GitHub, and you\u2019d like to continue working remotely for an open culture company, we\u2019ve been trying to hire a Python developer for a while. The old job ad is here. Get in touch if you\u2019re interested! Filled (and thanks to this blog post)!\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t",

The tactics described in the film are commonplace. It is simply too easy to hide who you you are and what you are doing behind companies.  This has to change. You can help fix this problem, and help cut off some of today\u2019s worst crimes at the source.This is a national problem, so to address it, Congress needs to act.   \nAnd this investigation shows New York to be at the heart of this issue. So the state's Congressional Delegation, including its senior Senator Chuck Schumer, need to demonstrate leadership.   This means moving their colleagues in Congress to support federal legislation to crack down on the abuse of anonymously owned shell companies in the U.S.  \nJoin us in calling on Sen. Schumer, New York\u2019s Congressional Delegation, and Congress to enact common sense reforms that make company ownership in the U.S. more transparent, and prevent our country from being a dumping ground for suspect money.  This petition is now closed, thank you to everyone who signed it!\nFor more on the problem of anonymous companies, watch this brilliant animation by our friends at TED.  \n  \n\n    For more on Global Witness's campaign to end anonymous company ownership, click here.   \n  \n\n    \n  ",

    "original_score": 21,
    "rm_score_original": 0.734375,
    "scraped_body": "In the following tutorial I will explain step-by-step how to connect a Windows PC to an Amiga to easily transfer files back and forth. This is an absolutely essential first step towards making your Amiga a relevant and useful machine, particularly with all of the fabulous files and programs available all over the place. \n\nI used the following (your hardware and OS may differ, and in most cases that is entirely fine):\n\n Amiga 1200 running Workbench 3.1 on a HDD (again, the OS version and HDD are not relevant but are what you will see in some images below)\n Windows PC running XP, Service Pack 3 \n Null Modem Cable \nIn my case, and I believe in most cases,  you need a 9-pin female port for the PC and 25-pin female port for the Amiga side. In technical terms the cable is called DB9F/DB25F. The cable I purchased on Amazon can be found here.      - Note that the pictures on Amazon, if you zoom into the product photo, these cables literally say \u201cnull modem\u201d on them. It\u2019s quite important to get the real deal and not some cable that looks like it will fit. Several resources I encountered (including Amiga Forever) made a point of getting \u201cthe real thing\u201d or to expect com port communication errors.\nThey should look like this:\ufffc\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n Amiga Explorer (AExplorer) which you can find here\nOnce installed on the Windows side, Amiga Explorer can self-install to the Amiga over the serial cable without requiring any additional software, but the Amiga must be able to boot first (e.g. with a Workbench disk, at least version 1.2)\nThose are really all of the things that you will need to perform this little procedure.  The Amiga Explorer program is PC-only, by the way.  I actually shelled out for the Amiga Forever Plus Edition, which comes with AExplorer along with a ton of other goodies, but you can get Explorer for only $10 if you only want to move files. It\u2019s worth it in my opinion. AmigaExplorer makes the transfer of files (as in multiple files, and larger than a floppy disk) extremely easy after the hardware side is taken care of. As I quoted earlier, it will install a program for you on your Amiga to help facilitate future transfers. More on that in a moment. \n\nFirst, let\u2019s set up the connection.\n\nWith the power off, plug your serial cable into the back of your PC and your Amiga. Be sure you plug the cable into the Serial port on the Amiga, not the Parallel port! They look the same. On my machine, you can see the serial port clearly labelled in the attached photo. Turn on both computers once the connection is solid. (I don\u2019t screw the cables in as once I finish transferring files I unplug, but that\u2019s up to you.)\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nTurn on your Amiga and launch Workbench. Find your Prefs folder and then the Serial program (the icon may look different than in the picture below depending on your version of Workbench).\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nDouble-click Serial and copy the following settings:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nNow boot your PC.\n\nIn Windows XP (or a similar version of Windows) right-click on My Computer, select Properties > Hardware (tab) > Device Manager > Ports (Com & LPT) > select Com port\n\nThis took me a couple of tries as I I wasn\u2019t sure which com port was which on my PC that I was plugging into. In the end mine tuned out to be Com Port 1. Yours could be different depending on your peripherals. Regardless, your settings on Windows should be set like this:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nNote how the PC settings are nearly the same. At this stage your Amiga and PC should both be on, connected, and ready for the final step: installing Amiga Explorer (think of AExplorer as a file browser on your PC of your Amiga) on your PC. \n\nLaunch the AExplorer installer, if you haven\u2019t before already. It will start the Setup program. If you had tried to launch it in the past in vain, right-click on the icon and select \u201cSetup\u201d from the menu to begin a series of pop-ups like you\u2019ve never seen before! But it\u2019s all good.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nYou\u2019ll then encounter a series of pop-ups about your hardware setup (which you\u2019ve already done) \u2026\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nAnd your version of Workbench\u2026\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nYou\u2019ll see another reminder about the port settings on your Amiga (and PC) that you\u2019ve already done\u2026.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nAnd then finally you\u2019ll be asked to reach over to your Amiga to perform a few simple tasks on the Amiga side...\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nAfter the install is complete, theAExplorer program will be installed for you on your Amiga in your RAM disk. I've since moved my AExplorer to my Workbench partition, which is the most logical place for me for regular use. \n\nIf you double-click the AExplorer icon on your Amiga, it will show you a brief screen of the port settings then suddenly vanish. Don\u2019t be fooled - it is still running in the background. But now if your Amiga Explorer program on the PC side is launched, you\u2019ll encounter a wonderful file browser \u2026 of your Amiga's file system!\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nYou can now easily drag files to your RAM disk (or wherever, if you have a HDD) to do as you please. Note that not all files can simply be transferred and launched (e.g. ADF files of your favorite game) as alas there are more variables involved. But there are many files that you can download on a PC and move to your Amiga, and vice versa. This is the beginning of what will keep your Amiga relevant for years to come.\n\nUPDATE:\nI've also created a semi-short video of this exact same topic where I walk you this this process and discuss some of the additional benefits of Amiga Explorer - particularly file management and ADF creation and transfers to disk.",

    "scraped_body": "Mark Suster wrote a great post yesterday titled\u00a0The Resetting of the Startup Industry. Go read it now \u2013 I\u2019ll wait.Once again, as we find ourselves in the middle of a significant public market correction, especially around technology stocks, there\u2019s an enormous amount of noise in the system, as there always is. Much of it is very short term focused and, like a giant tractor beam, draws the conversation into a very short time horizon (as in days or weeks). And, rather than rational and helpful thoughts for entrepreneurs, it often brings out the schadenfreude in even the most talented people.Mark\u2019s post is one of the first in this cycle that I\u2019ve seen from a VC giving clear, actionable advice . One of my favorite lines in buried in the middle:\u201cI\u2019ve\u00a0heard enough companies say \u201cwe simply can\u2019t cut costs or it will hurt the long-term potential of the business\u201d to get a wry smile. We entrepreneurs have been spinning that line for decades in every boom cycle. It\u2019s simply not true. Pragmatic cost cuts are always possible and often productive.\u201dMany companies have hired ahead of their growth rate because they had the cash to do so. In our portfolio, we generally don\u2019t have this problem because we aren\u2019t big fans of either (a) overfunding companies or (b) escalating burn rates based on headcount. But, occasionally we find ourselves in the position on the board of a company where, as you look forward, you realize you are burning more than you should be for the stage you are at. As Mark suggests, this is a moment when you can proactively make\u00a0pragmatic cuts. It will suck for a few days but feel a lot better in the long term.But, more importantly, is another point Mark buries later on, which includes an awesome post of his from 2010.\u201cIf you need to clean up your own cap table first \u2013 while very hard to do \u2013 it will make outside funding easier\u201dAgain, go read the post now \u2013 I\u2019ll wait. It\u2019s so nice there are other great VC bloggers who write this stuff so I can just point at it.I learned this lesson 127 times between 2000 and 2005. I started investing in 1994 and while there was some bumpiness in 1997 and again in 1999, the real pain happened between 2000 and 2005. I watched, participated, and suffered through every type of creative financing as companies were struggling to raise capital in this time frame. I\u2019ve seen every imaginable type of liquidation preference structure, pay-to-play dynamic, preferred return, ratchet, share/option bonus, option repricing, and carveout. I suffered through the next financing after implementing a complex structure, or a sale of the company, or a liquidation. I\u2019ve spent way too much time with lawyers, rights offerings, liquidation waterfalls, and angry/frustrated people who are calculating share ownership by class to see if they can exert pressure on an outcome that they really can\u2019t impact anyway, and certainly haven\u2019t been constructively contributing to.I have two simple rules for founders in my head from this experience. First, make sure you know where the capital is going to come from to fully fund your business. You might have it in the bank already. Your existing investors might be willing to provide it. Or you might need to raise it. Until you are consistently generating positive cash flow, you depend on someone else for financing. And, in this kind of environment, that can be very painful, especially if you need to go find someone who isn\u2019t already an investor in your company (e.g. your insiders require there to be an outside lead, or you need to raise much more capital than your insiders can provide.)Second, keep your capital structure simple. There are three things that will mess\u00a0you up in the long run:Too much liquidation preference: My simple rule of thumb is that if you\u2019ve raised more than $25m and\u00a0your liquidation preference is greater than 50% of your post money valuation, you have too much liquidation preference. This is a little tricky in early rounds and with modest up-round financings, as you\u2019ll often have a liquidation preference that is high relative to your overall valuation. But, as you raise more money at higher valuations, this will normalize. Then, if you end up doing a down round, it suddenly matters a lot. Don\u2019t worry about this too much, until you do a down round. Then use the down round to clean up your preference overhang.Complex liquidation preference:\u00a0In an effort to keep from doing a down round, or too much of a down round, there will be tension between your old investors and your new investors (if you have them) around your new liquidation preferences. Often, there will be asymmetry between them with your new liquidation preferences having a multiple on them where they participate for a while up to a cap. Or participate forever. If you don\u2019t know what this means, welcome to the world of terms other than price suddenly mattering, which Jason and I talk about extensively in our book Venture Deals. Deal with reality as a founder as well as an investor group and avoid this complexity \u2013 just clean up your cap table instead.Carveouts: After spending hours working through yet another messed up carveout that I inherited from an old bubble-era deal, I realized I hated carveouts. They are almost always written in a way that doesn\u2019t really hold up, creates misalignment, or is a negotiating anchor in an acquisition situation. When I see a carveout being proposed these days, I know there\u2019s\u00a0a liquidation preference problem.Mark\u2019s post has good solutions for each of these, but the best\u00a0is \u2013 as a founding team\u00a0\u2013 to work with your investors to make sure that everyone is aligned for the upside case, rather than focused on protecting their capital in the downside case.\u00a0For this, like so many other things in life, means \u201csimple is better.\u201d Most importantly, don\u2019t be afraid to talk about it early, well before you have to go through another financing round.",

This is the first functional study of neuronal synaptic activity using uncoated graphene-based materials.\u201d They then tested the ability of neurons to generate electrical signals known to represent brain activities and found that the neurons retained their neuronal signalling properties unaltered. This is said to be the first functional study of neuronal synaptic activity using uncoated graphene-based materials.\nThe research, published in the journal ACS Nano, was an interdisciplinary they have successfully demonstrated how it is possible to interface graphene \u2013 a two-dimensional form of carbon \u2013 with neurons, or nerve cells while maintaining the integrity of these vital cells. The work may be used to build graphene-based electrodes that can safely be implanted in the brain, offering promise for the restoration of sensory functions for amputee or paralysed patients, or for individuals with motor disorders such as epilepsy or Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\nAccording to the researchers, this is the first step towards using pristine graphene-based materials as an electrode for a neuro-interface. In future, the researchers will investigate how different forms of graphene, from multiple layers to monolayers, are able to affect neurons, and whether tuning the material properties of graphene might alter the synapses and neuronal excitability in new and unique ways. \u201cHopefully, this will pave the way for better deep brain implants to both harness and control the brain, with higher sensitivity and fewer unwanted side effects,\u201d said Ballerini. \u201cWe are currently involved in frontline research in graphene technology towards biomedical applications,\u201d said Professor Maurizio Prato from the University of Trieste. \u201cIn this scenario, the development and translation of the neurology of graphene-based high-performance biodevices require the exploration of the interactions between graphene nano- and micro-sheets with the sophisticated signalling machinery of nerve cells. Our work is only a first step in that direction.\u201d \u201cThese initial results show how we are just at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential of graphene and related materials in bio-applications and medicine,\u201d said Professor Andrea Ferrari, Director of the Cambridge Graphene Centre. \u201cThe expertise developed at the Cambridge Graphene Centre allows us to produce large quantities of pristine material in solution, and this study proves the compatibility of our process with neuro-interfaces.\u201d The research was funded by the Graphene Flagship, a European initiative which promotes a collaborative approach to research with an aim of helping to translate graphene out of the academic laboratory, through local industry and into society.\n                                \n                                            \n                    \n                ",

Headed by diversity consultant Nicole Sanchez, the team\u2019s previous achievements include\u00a0working with the White House to fit \u201clow-income homes\u201d with free Wi-Fi around the country, but the team is now focused on diversifying the company\u2019s workforce.\n\u201cIt is very hard to even interview people who are \u2018white,\u2019\u201d claimed an anonymous GitHub employee speaking to Tech Insider. It\u2019s a claim that seems shocking but should come as no surprise considering Sanchez\u2019s previous outspoken statements on diversity.\nIn February 2015, Sanchez wrote an article for USA Today entitled \u201cMore white women does not equal tech diversity,\u201d and during a diversity training talk Sanchez even stated that technology was \u201cnot work for white folks to lead\u201d and that \u201csome of the biggest barriers to progress are white women.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDanilo Campos, the technical director at GitHub\u2019s Social Impact Team, is also no stranger to controversial comments about race.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019ll succeed teaching white, male middle managers empathy and compassion anytime soon. So let\u2019s limit their scope of damage,\u201d wrote Campos in one tweet.\n\nSoon after the Tech Insider piece was published, Campos was quick to deny all allegations against him and the Social Impact Team.\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe EVERYTHING you read, but: I\u2019m proud to be part of an expert team telling the truth on tech diversity,\u201d wrote Campos in another tweet\u00a0featuring a\u00a0link to the article. \u201cAll right, now I\u2019m gonna get baked and watch the pilot of the West Wing because I am living my best life,\u201d he added a few hours later.\nCampos wasn\u2019t the only employee to respond to the situation, with Sanchez making her Twitter account private; a tactic commonly used by figures of controversy in order to temporarily hide and delete statements which may be used against them.\n\nDiversifying the workplace is not uncommon in today\u2019s technology landscape, with leading giants\u00a0such as\u00a0Twitter, Dropbox, and Yahoo engaging in a variety\u00a0of diversity programmes, but GitHub seems to have taken the mantle for most racially controversial. Many users on social media, including regular users of GitHub, have expressed outrage.\nhttps://twitter.com/Grummz/status/696176186490114048\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/696180096865071104\nGitHub has not yet publicly responded to the situation.\nCharlie Nash is a libertarian writer, memeologist, and child prodigy. When he is not writing, he can usually be found chilling at the Korova Milk Bar, mingling with the infamous. You can follow him on Twitter at\u00a0@MrNashington.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n",

The Encyclopedia \n            of Trees, Shrubs, and Vines is based on Ron \n            Bracewell\u2019s Trees \n            of Stanford and Environs.\n          \n          Prominent among campus tree enthusiasts was William \n            Russel Dudley, 1849\u20131911, Stanford\u2019s first professor of botany. Dudley was instrumental in the establishment \n            of Big Basin State Park and Pinnacles National Monument, an advocate for \n            sustainable forestry practices, and a director of the Sierra Club. One \n            of his many interests was California\u2019s coniferous forests, an arboreal \n            wonder of the world for their diversity and grandeur. A fitting memorial \n            to Prof. Dudley is the century-old Santa \n            Lucia fir  growing between the George P. Shultz Building and Jane Stanford Way,\n            in the remnant Encina Garden. Dudley made many \n            trips to remote regions of the Santa Lucia Mountains to study and collect \n            specimens of this beautiful and enigmatic tree. Stanford\u2019s Dudley Herbarium \n            has been integrated into the collection of the California \n            Academy of Sciences. Read more about Professor Dudley and Stanford\u2019s \n          rich botanical heritage. \n            Senator Stanford\u2019s preference was that no healthy oak tree be\n     cut down on the farm, and thousands of native California oaks have been\n     planted from the 1880s up to the present. Today, portions of the campus\n     tree canopy are dominated by coast live oak, the most numerous tree on Stanford University lands. Valley, blue, and black oaks can also be found on central campus, the Academic Preserve, and Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. There has been loss of diversity\n     from the original tree and shrub plantings of the 1880s and 1890s, \n    which is well-documented for conifers. Over the past quarter century \n    there has also been a loss of eucalypt species,\n     from over 125 species present in the early 1970s to fifty-one today. \n    Stanford has had in the past one of the most diverse collections of \n    eucalypts in California and still has some mature specimens of very \n    rare and unique trees. The superb restoration of the Arizona Garden \u2013 and\n    its ongoing care and enhancement directed by garden coordinator \n    Christy Smith \u2013 emphasizes the potential for a broader restoration of \n    the remaining, intact Arboretum region.\n        \n    About Us\n\n            Trees.stanford.edu is a labor of love. It honors Ron and Helen Bracewell and the groundskeepers, botanists, \n            university planners\n            and architects, and community \n            volunteers who have contributed over the past century to Leland \n            Stanford\u2019s vision of growing an arboretum at his Palo Alto farm.\n    \n            Sairus Patel and John Rawlings serve as editors (contact us).\n\n            This website, originally a SULAIR and Stanford \n            Historical Society digital initiative, was created in 2005 by John Rawlings.

    "scraped_body": "Marcus Brauchli is a former executive editor of The Washington Post and managing editor of the Wall Street Journal.In journalist Michael S. Malone\u2019s telling, the world\u2019s most important company is audaciously innovative, viciously competitive and boundlessly visionary, leaping from success to success as it upends and reshapes industries. If you are 30 or younger, though, you may have trouble guessing this particular technology company\u2019s identity. At the barricades of the mobile revolution, where cellphones and tablets inspire the masses, its name is seldom mentioned. The do-no-wrong industrial insurgent that Malone idolizes in his new Silicon Valley corporate history largely missed out on those movements.I know this because, while reading Malone's lively if frequently hyperbolic \n\"The Intel Trinity,\"\n I happened to be at a conference where Intel's current leader was onstage, explaining its slip-up. \"Companies make mistakes,\" Brian Krzanich, Intel's graying and genial chief executive, told an audience of mostly younger technologists in May at the Re/code conference in California. After leading the transformation of computing from mainframes to personal computers to laptops, the company \"wanted it to stop there,\" Krzanich admitted. \"But the market kept moving.\"And that, in fact, is the theme that pulses through Malone\u2019s book. In the half-century since Intel\u2019s visionary founders joined the workforce, the pace of technological change has only accelerated, creating \u2014 and almost as quickly rendering obsolete \u2014 inventions, companies, even industries. For more than a generation, the company that best managed those forces was Intel.Intel sat \u201cat the center of the world\u2019s economy, the multi-billion-dollar corporation on which the entire electronics revolution would rest,\u201d Malone writes. Far from wanting technology to stop evolving, Intel invested massively in research and development, pushing the boundaries not only of technology but of the technology business.Its founding engineers helped pioneer the silicon-based memory chips from which California\u2019s storied Silicon Valley drew its name, then assembled the team that pretty much invented the microprocessors that enabled the creation of personal computers and the computer-driven era we live in today. So far ahead of the curve was Intel that it often had to educate its customers in how to deploy its technologies.In business, too, Intel was an innovator. It offered its users services and customization, not just off-the-shelf, mass-produced products, and understood the importance of cannibalizing its own products to adopt new technologies and create new businesses.Success brought challenges: Intel outmaneuvered American and Japanese copycat manufacturers, sweated out prolonged economic downcycles, and became a fulcrum of U.S. trade policy for years. Yet it always survived, strengthened.Businesses, ultimately, are manifestations of their people and especially their leaders. Intel was emphatically so. The vision that drove the company was that of three men, all of them legendary in Silicon Valley, whose intertwined stories form the narrative spine of Malone\u2019s book. \u201cThere is .\u2009.\u2009. something almost biblical about the relationship,\u201d Malone suggests, \u201can unholy Trinity.\u201dThe company\u2019s founder and the \u201cFather\u201d of Malone\u2019s minor heresy, Robert Noyce, was a charismatic and charming skier, pilot and brilliant engineer who forged Intel\u2019s original team in 1968 from among his colleagues at an earlier technology enterprise he\u2019d created, Fairchild Semiconductor. Chief among them was Gordon Moore, another surpassingly smart engineer, who in 1965 wrote a paper laying out what became known as \u201cMoore\u2019s Law,\u201d the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit would double every two years. The recognition that processing speeds or memory could increase at that exponential rate enabled Intel to plan and roll out new technologies at a faster pace than its rivals.Moore also was the guardian of the third of Intel\u2019s great leaders, Andrew Grove, a strong-willed and sometimes irascible Hungarian-born engineer who was brought to Intel after its founding and eventually oversaw the company\u2019s greatest growth. While Noyce and Moore got much credit \u2014 and enormous wealth \u2014 for founding Intel, it was Grove\u2019s ferocious drive that propelled the company to quickly commercialize new technologies, shed old ones and become dominant in computing.At the center of the book is the running friction between Noyce and Grove. Grove respected Noyce but disdained his leadership style. \u201cGrove was the brilliant but truculent Son in a perpetual Oedipal battle with Noyce,\u201d Malone writes. They clashed repeatedly; Moore provided the buffer that allowed both men to exercise their wills and Intel to flourish.Each of these men is worthy of a biography; Grove wrote his own, \"Only the Paranoid Survive,\" an important and powerful memoir of life in the 20th century. Malone sets this new book apart by focusing on the interactions among the trio, illuminating the frictions inside Intel. He is careful to credit the many other engineers who helped build Intel into the first Silicon Valley company to achieve a stock market value of half a trillion dollars.Those stories often give the book a discursive, meandering feel that Malone accentuates with declarations of the importance of every matter, great or small. When an Intel customer doesn\u2019t insist on exclusive rights to a new Intel technology, Malone characterizes it as \u201cone of the biggest business mistakes of the century.\u201d The death of Noyce in 1990 was a shock, Malone writes, but then adds: \u201cThere has never been as devastating a piece of news before or since in the Valley.\u201dMalone is a technology enthusiast; indeed, his other book titles seem to leave little space for the importance he ascribes to Intel: \n\"Bill & Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company\" and \n\"Infinite Loop: How Apple, the World's Most Insanely Great Computer Company, Went Insane.\" Readers may be stymied by Malone's inside-the-Valley use of techno-jargon that often omits plain-English explanations for some of the most significant advances he describes. (He includes a \"Tutorial on Technology\" as an appendix, which \nis useful for understanding where technology is going but less so for where it has been.)But most problematic for both Malone and Intel is the abbreviated denouement to this book: When Krzanich became chief executive in 2013, after 31 years at the company, Intel had less than 1 percent of the mobile market, the new business segment dominated by companies like Apple and Samsung.That raises perhaps the most profound unanswered question of the book and of Silicon Valley\u2019s past half-century: How is it that even the most agile and powerful companies falter and lose the cadence of innovation that made them great? Malone doesn\u2019t offer an answer. What he has produced is popular history, the tale of an epoch-defining industrial romp and the three men who led it.THE INTEL TRINITYHow Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove Built the World\u2019s Most Important CompanyBy Michael S.

    "scraped_body": "Background:A creative team of visual strategists at JPL, known as \"The Studio,\" created the poster series, which is titled \"Visions of the Future.\" Nine artists, designers, and illustrators were involved in designing the 14 posters, which are the result of many brainstorming sessions with JPL scientists, engineers, and expert communicators. Each poster went through a number of concepts and revisions, and each was made better with feedback from the JPL experts.David Delgado, creative strategy:The posters began as a series about exoplanets -- planets orbiting other stars -- to celebrate NASA's study of them. (The NASA program that focuses on finding and studying exoplanets is managed by JPL.) Later, the director of JPL was on vacation at the Grand Canyon with his wife, and they saw a similarly styled poster that reminded them of the exoplanet posters. They suggested it might be wonderful to give a similar treatment to the amazing destinations in our solar system that JPL is currently exploring as part of NASA. And they were right!The point was to share a sense of things on the edge of possibility that are closely tied to the work our people are doing today. The JPL director has called our people \"architects of the future.\"As for the style, we gravitated to the style of the old posters the WPA created for the national parks. There's a nostalgia for that era that just feels good.Joby Harris, illustrator:The old WPA posters did a really great job delivering a feeling about a far-off destination. They were created at a time when color photography was not very advanced, in order to capture the beauty of the national parks from a human perspective. These posters show places in our solar system (and beyond) that likewise haven't been photographed on a human scale yet -- or in the case of the exoplanets might never be, at least not for a long time. It seemed a perfect way to help people imagine these strange, new worlds.Delgado:The WPA poster style is beloved, and other artists have embraced it before us. Our unique take was to take one specific thing about the place and focus on the science of it. We chose exoplanets that had really interesting, strange qualities, and everything about the poster was designed to amplify the concept. The same model guided us for the posters that focus on destinations in the solar system.Lois Kim, typography:We worked hard to get the typography right, since that was a very distinctive element in creating the character of those old posters. We wanted to create a retro-future feel, so we didn't adhere exactly to the period styles, but they definitely informed the design. The Venus poster has a very curvy, flowy font, for example, to evoke a sense of the clouds.",

    "scraped_body": "I have not been blogging much because I have been working on my book, but many people have asked me about the markets. So here are my thoughts.Much of the recovery in the labor market since 2008 had been driven by jobs in the oil and gas industry. These were high paying jobs that went into parts of the country that otherwise are struggling economically. A lot of US production, however, is profitable only at oil prices of $60/barrel and above (some are saying $80/barrel). Crude oil is currently at or below $30/barrel, which means that US production is contracting rapidly. The companies behind this are heavily debt financed, to the tune of $500 Billion. A big chunk of that debt will be worthless.So the US is facing a double whammy of reduced employment growth and a debt bust which will lead to reduced credit across the economy (see this accessible website for an explanation of credit cycles). Add to this the troubles in the Chinese economy and In combination there is a realistic fear that the US and maybe the world at large are headed back into a recession. Various early warning indicators such as an inverted yield curve and this odd metric (YMMV) are also pointing to the possibility of another recession.So what about Tech then? Fred had a great post earlier this week about the multiple compression for SaaS companies. The primary reason behind this is that the market has grown tired of companies spending money in an undisciplined fashion. For a while there was such a growth premium that almost any amount of spend on sales and marketing was seen as a positive. And the market also seemed to tolerate high spend in engineering without looking at product velocity. The same was true for many private companies that had raised increasingly larger rounds at ever higher valuations and grown used to it.Well now we are in a completely different climate. Operational excellence will be at a real premium. Companies need to look at how effective their sales and marketing spend really is. They have to either show real product velocity or cut down engineering (incidentally, the latter will likely increase product velocity as there are many bloated teams out there). The companies that commit to that and start to show the results in their metrics will weather this storm. But the time to get going is now, especially for anyone who still needs to raise more money.",

    "original_score": 1,

    "scraped_body": "Ends warranty, servicing transfers for used vehiclesOn Sunday, electric automotive manufacturer Tesla quietly raised prices on its post-purchase servicing options, including the annual maintenance prices of servicing its Model S and Model X vehicles. The company also announced a ban on the transfer of factory extended warranties and prepaid servicing packages to buyers of used Tesla vehicles.\n\t  \t\nSince 2012, Tesla has recommended Model S and Model X owners have their cars serviced every year, or approximately every 12,500 miles. Before Sunday, Tesla owners could pre-purchase yearly servicing at $1,900 for 4 years, or $3,800 for 8 years. As of now, the same services will cost $2,100 for 4 years and $4,000 for 8 years. This brings the total of each plan up by $200 over four years. The company has also removed free wheel alignments as part of its maintenance packages, according to recent adjustments on its vehicle configurator\u00a0webpages.\nA possible impact of this decision is a Tesla owner not being able to sell a vehicle for the same resale value, as they will not be able to include a multi-year factory warranty. Some analysts have reassured the media that this isn\u2019t likely to be an issue, citing the affluence of its average customer.\n\"Tesla has an affluent customer base, and these buyers rarely keep a car longer than 4 years or 50,000 miles,\" says Karl Brauer, automotive industry analyst for Kelley Blue Book. \"By eliminating the warranty transfer option Tesla has largely neutralized the benefits of its extended warranty coverage. It lets Tesla technically offer longer vehicle coverage while exposing the automaker to minimal real-world cost increases... Bottom line, if you can't transfer the warranty, your options as a buyer are reduced.\"\nPerhaps the bigger change to Tesla\u2019s servicing options as of Sunday is the removal of being able to transfer extended warranty and prepaid service plans when selling a used Tesla Model S or Model X. The new policy imposes a ban on transferring extended warranties and prepaid servicing packages to new owners. Existing owners will be able to cancel their existing plans and get pro-rated reimbursements for the remaining warranty or servicing timeframe, but they will not be able to transfer them to new owners. In the past, these transfers cost a new only just $100. Now, they will pay the full price just as the previous owner did.\nTesla may be removing the extended warranty transfer option simply because it believes most buyers will not have their vehicles longer than 4 to 5 years. This would imply that launch-day Tesla Model S owners who received their vehicles in Q4 2012 are due for another upgrade in Q4 2017. Perhaps the company will have improved the efficiency of its battery units and drivetrains so significantly that many users will be convinced to sell and upgrade to the new full-refresh model year lineup.\nWith the company\u2019s midrange Model 3 announcement next month, we are expecting the technological improvements and drivetrain enhancements may give consumers a hint at what to expect with the next full refreshes to its flagship Model S and Model X lineups when those days arrive in the near future.\t  ",

    "scraped_body": "Laboratory!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Python library for carefully refactoring critical paths by testing in\nproduction (inspired by GitHub's Scientist) with support for Python 2.7, 3.3+\n\nWhy?\nInstallation\nGetting started\nAdding context\nRamping up\nControlling comparison\nRaise on mismatch\nPublishing results\nCaveats\nLinks\n\n\nWhy?\nSome blocks of code are more critical than the rest. Laboratory helps us refactor important\ncode paths by running experiments in production and verifying the results.\nThe value lies in its ability to give us a sense of confidence where there was none before.\nThrough experimentation we immediately see if candidate code is misbehaving, and at the same\ntime we establish a feedback loop that we can use to converge on correctness more quickly.\nI've written a blog post if you'd like to know more: Sure-footed refactoring.\nThe original blog post that inspired this project is worth a read too: Scientist.\n\nInstallation\nInstalling from pypi is recommended\n$ pip install laboratory\n\nYou can also install a tagged version from Github\n$ pip install https://github.com/joealcorn/laboratory/archive/v1.0.tar.gz\n\nOr the latest development version\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/joealcorn/laboratory.git\n\n\nGetting started\nSee: Installation or pip install laboratory\nWith Laboratory you conduct an experiment with your known-good code as the\ncontrol block and a new code branch as a candidate. Laboratory will:\n\nExecute the new and the old code in a randomised order\nCompare the return values\nRecord timing information about old & new code\nCatch (but record!) exceptions in the new code\nPublish all of this information\n\nLet's imagine you're refactoring some authorisation code. Your existing code\nis working, but it's a fragile pile of spaghetti that is becoming hard to\nmaintain. You want to refactor, but this is important code and you simply can't\nafford to get this wrong or else you risk exposing user data.\nConsidering the state of the original code, this could be difficult to pull off,\nbut Laboratory is here to help.\nLaboratory helps us verify the correctness of our implementation even with the\ncornucopia of factors that make production a unique environment (bad or legacy\ndata, heavy load, etc.)\nLet's set up an experiment to run our old (control) and new (candidate) code:\nimport laboratory\n\n# set up the experiment and define control and candidate functions\nexperiment = laboratory.Experiment()\nexperiment.control(authorise_control, args=[user], kwargs={'action': action})\nexperiment.candidate(authorise_candidate, args=[user], kwargs={'action': action})\n\n# conduct the experiment and return the control value\nauthorised = experiment.conduct()\nNote that the Experiment class can also be used as a decorator if the\ncontrol and candidate functions take the same arguments.\ndef authorise_candidate(user, action=None):\n    return True\n\n@Experiment.decorator(candidate=authorise_candidate)\ndef authorise_control(user, action=None):\n    return True\nAn experiment will always return the value of the control block.\n\nAdding context\nA lot of the time there's going to be extra context around an experiment that's\nuseful to use in publishing or when verifying results. There are a couple ways\nto set this.\n# The first is experiment-wide context, which will be set on every Observation an experiment makes\nexperiment = laboratory.Experiment(name='Authorisation experiment', context={'action': action})\n\n# Context can also be set on an Observation-specific basis\nexperiment.control(control_func, context={'strategy': 1})\nexperiment.candidate(cand_func, context={'strategy': 2})\nContext can be retrieved using the get_context method on Experiment and Observation instances.\nclass Experiment(laboratory.Experiment):\n    def publish(self, result):\n        self.get_context()\n        result.control.get_context()\n        result.candidates[0].get_context()\n\nRamping up\nBefore running a candidate code block Laboratory will call Experiment.enabled.\nBy overriding this method we can control when the candidate code will be executed.\nFor example, if we wanted to enable the experiment for just 10% of calls, we could\ndo something along these lines:\nclass MyExperiment(laboratory.Experiment):\n    def enabled(self):\n        return random.random() < 0.1\nThis is useful for slowly ramping up the experiment, but because we have access to\nthe experiment context in the enabled method, we're also able to do fancier\nthings like enabling only for specific users.\nclass MyExperiment(laboratory.Experiment):\n    def enabled(self):\n        ctx = self.get_context()\n        return ctx['user'] in user_segment\n\nControlling comparison\nNot all data is created equal. By default laboratory compares using ==, but\nsometimes you may need to tweak this to suit your needs.  It's easy enough \u2014\nsubclass Experiment and implement the compare(control, candidate) method.\nclass MyExperiment(Experiment):\n    def compare(self, control, candidate):\n        return control.value['id'] == candidate.value['id']\n\nRaise on mismatch\nThe Experiment class accepts a raise_on_mismatch argument which you can set\nto True if you want Laboratory to raise an exception when the comparison returns\nfalse. This may be useful in testing, for example.\n\nPublishing results\nThis data is useless unless we can do something with it. Laboratory makes no\nassumptions about how to do this \u2014 it's entirely for you to implement to suit\nyour needs.  For example, timing data can be sent to graphite, and mismatches\ncan be placed in a capped collection in redis for debugging later.\nThe publish method is passed a Result instance, with control and candidate\ndata is available in Result.control and Result.candidates\nrespectively.\nclass MyExperiment(laboratory.Experiment):\n    def publish(self, result):\n        statsd.timing('MyExperiment.control', result.control.duration)\n        for o in result.candidates:\n            statsd.timing('MyExperiment.%s' % o.name, o.duration)\n\nCaveats\nBecause of the way Laboratory works, there are some situations in which it should\nnot be used. Namely, any code with side effects, such as disk or database writes,\nor other state changes, are unsuitable as they'll lead to duplicated writes.\nYou could end up with buggy data or a candidate that affects the execution of\nthe control.\nYou\u2019ll also take a performance hit by running your new code in addition to the old,\nso be mindful of that. You should ramp an experiment up slowly and keep an eye on\nyour metrics.\n\nLinks\n\nDocumentation\nSource code\nCI server\nPython Package Index\nSure-footed refactoring\n\n\nMaintenance\nLaboratory is actively maintained by Joe Alcorn (Github, Twitter)\n\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n      In the previous post I\u2019ve introduced the hwloc-rs library, which allows you to discover and manage hardware topologies. Discovering the capabilities of a machine is insightful, but it gets more interesting if you can perform certain actions based on those insights.\nBinding threads or processes to distinct CPU cores is very important in high performance applications to isolate workloads, keep inter-core messaging latency to a minimum and also to prevent the operating system from relocating your threads between cores as it sees fit. This becomes even more important in NUMA architectures, where the memory access latency depends on the memory location relative to the processors (binding memory chunks, while also supported by hwloc is not covered in this post).\nExample Benchmarks with OpenMPI and Intel MPI on a 12-core Xeon E5 show that the throughput and latency vary greatly when passing messages between cores. Between cores on the same NUMA node the latency is around 330ns with a throughput of 4220MiB/s, but once messages need to cross the boundaries between cores in different NUMA nodes the latency shoots up to 590ns and the throughput drops to 3410MiB/s.\nAs always with such low-level concerns like this, the APIs differ across operating systems and some platforms don\u2019t even support CPU binding at all. This is where hwloc shines again - it provides us with easy to use abstractions that we can readily use in our rust code. The following blog post explains the different options (checking for support, process binding, thread binding) in greater detail.\nThe docs provide helpful instructions to get started, but make sure you pick up at least version 0.3.0 if you want to try it out:\n[dependencies]\nhwloc = \"0.3.0\"\nChecking for Support\nBefore even thinking about binding your thread or process to a specific core you need to check whether your target platform supports it. Spoiler: if you are thinking about trying this on OSX, you are out of luck. But this gives us a chance to compare the output of the following code on Linux and OSX:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\n\nextern crate hwloc;\n\nuse hwloc::Topology;\n\n/// Example on how to check for specific topology support of a feature.\nfn main() {\n    let topo = Topology::new();\n\n    // Check if Process Binding for CPUs is supported\n    println!(\"CPU Binding (current process) supported: {}\", topo.support().cpu().set_current_process());\n    println!(\"CPU Binding (any process) supported: {}\", topo.support().cpu().set_process());\n\n    // Check if Thread Binding for CPUs is supported\n    println!(\"CPU Binding (current thread) supported: {}\", topo.support().cpu().set_current_thread());\n    println!(\"CPU Binding (any thread) supported: {}\", topo.support().cpu().set_thread());\n\n    // Debug Print all the Support Flags\n    println!(\"All Flags:\\n{:?}\", topo.support());\n}\n\n\nOn Linux:\nCPU Binding (current process) supported: true\nCPU Binding (any process) supported: true\nCPU Binding (current thread) supported: true\nCPU Binding (any thread) supported: true\nAll Flags:\nTopologyDiscoverySupport { pu: 1 }, TopologyCpuBindSupport { set_thisproc_cpubind: 1, get_thisproc_cpubind: 1, set_proc_cpubind: 1, get_proc_cpubind: 1, set_thisthread_cpubind: 1, get_thisthread_cpubind: 1, set_thread_cpubind: 1, get_thread_cpubind: 1, get_thisproc_last_cpu_location: 1, get_proc_last_cpu_location: 1, get_thisthread_last_cpu_location: 1 }, TopologyMemBindSupport { (omitted) }\nOn OSX:\nCPU Binding (current process) supported: false\nCPU Binding (any process) supported: false\nCPU Binding (current thread) supported: false\nCPU Binding (any thread) supported: false\nAll Flags:\nTopologyDiscoverySupport { pu: 1 }, TopologyCpuBindSupport { set_thisproc_cpubind: 0, get_thisproc_cpubind: 0, set_proc_cpubind: 0, get_proc_cpubind: 0, set_thisthread_cpubind: 0, get_thisthread_cpubind: 0, set_thread_cpubind: 0, get_thread_cpubind: 0, get_thisproc_last_cpu_location: 0, get_proc_last_cpu_location: 0, get_thisthread_last_cpu_location: 0 }, TopologyMemBindSupport { (omitted) }\nAs a result, the following sections use a (virtual) Linux machine with 4 cores to demonstrate the binding capabilities. To give you some context, here is the lstopo output of the VM:\n$ uname -a\nLinux vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64 3.13.0-71-generic #114-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 1 02:34:22 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n$ lstopo -p --no-io\nMachine (490MB) + Socket P#0 + L2d (6144KB)\n  L1d (32KB) + Core P#0 + PU P#0\n  L1d (32KB) + Core P#1 + PU P#1\n  L1d (32KB) + Core P#2 + PU P#2\n  L1d (32KB) + Core P#3 + PU P#3  \nThe CpuSet\nOne important type to know when performing CPU binding operations is the CpuSet. The CpuSet is just a type alias for a generic Bitmap which has its bits set according to CPU physical OS indexes.\nYou can create a CpuSets instance too, but in general you will retrieve them through the topology or its objects, then copy/modify it and finally use it for your custom CPU binding. Every bitmap implements the Display and the Debug trait (amongst others), so printing their values is often a good idea. The next examples will make heavy use of CpuSets, so make sure to browse around the API a bit and make yourself familiar with it.\nProcess Binding\nIf your platform supports it as well, hwloc provides two different ways to bind a process. You can either bind the current process or an arbitrary process identified by its process ID (commonly referred to as pid).\nBinding the Current Process\nHere is an example which binds the current process to the last core available:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n\nextern crate hwloc;\n\nuse hwloc::{Topology, TopologyObject, ObjectType, CPUBIND_PROCESS};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut topo = Topology::new();\n\n    let mut cpuset = last_core(&mut topo).cpuset().unwrap();\n    cpuset.singlify();\n\n    println!(\"Cpu Binding before explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpubind(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\n    println!(\"Cpu Location before explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpu_location(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\n\n    match topo.set_cpubind(cpuset, CPUBIND_PROCESS) {\n        Ok(_) => println!(\"Correctly bound to last core\"),\n        Err(e) => println!(\"Failed to bind: {:?}\", e)\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Cpu Binding after explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpubind(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\n    println!(\"Cpu Location after explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpu_location(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\n}\n\n/// Helper method to find the last core\nfn last_core(topo: &mut Topology) -> &TopologyObject {\n    let core_depth = topo.depth_or_below_for_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap();\n    let all_cores = topo.objects_at_depth(core_depth);\n    all_cores.last().unwrap()\n}\n\nThis prints the following on the linux machine:\nCpu Binding before explicit bind: Some(0-3)\nCpu Location before explicit bind: Some(2)\nCorrectly bound to last core\nCpu Binding after explicit bind: Some(3)\nCpu Location after explicit bind: Some(3)\nSo let\u2019s break it apart a bit. The first thing we need to do is find the CpuSet for the last core so we have a reference to bind it to. Note that this singlify call here is useful so that the process does not have a chance of migrating between multiple logical CPUs in the original mask.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n\n\nlet mut cpuset = last_core(&mut topo).cpuset().unwrap();\ncpuset.singlify();\n\n//...\n\nfn last_core(topo: &mut Topology) -> &TopologyObject {\n    let core_depth = topo.depth_or_below_for_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap();\n    let all_cores = topo.objects_at_depth(core_depth);\n    all_cores.last().unwrap()\n}\n\nNow that we have our \u201ctarget\u201d, we can start binding the current process there. To visualise what\u2019s going on, we also print the binding and location for the current process before and after the explicit binding:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n\n\nprintln!(\"Cpu Binding before explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpubind(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\nprintln!(\"Cpu Location before explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpu_location(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\n\nmatch topo.set_cpubind(cpuset, CPUBIND_PROCESS) {\n    Ok(_) => println!(\"Correctly bound to last core\"),\n    Err(e) => println!(\"Failed to bind: {:?}\", e)\n}\n\nprintln!(\"Cpu Binding after explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpubind(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\nprintln!(\"Cpu Location after explicit bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpu_location(CPUBIND_PROCESS));\n\nThe current CpuSet of the process (which you can retrieve through get_cpubind(CPUBIND_PROCESS)) contains all possibles cores where the operating system might dispatch the process on. In our case it prints 0-3 which means all four cores are possible. The call to get_cpu_location() gives us the current core location, but this can change between subsequent calls as the operating system moves the process around.\nFinally we override the current binding with our custom one (the new CpuSet only contains the last core rather than all four) and apply some simple matching to make sure the binding didn\u2019t fail for some reason. The last println! calls are just there to visually validate the new binding.\nBinding an Arbitrary Process\nBinding any process works very similar to binding the current process, but there is one difference - we need to find the pid of the process we want to bind. This is a little out of scope for this blog post, but since our own process also has a pid we can use that one for our examples. Unfortunately we need a little bit of unsafe libc magic there:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\nextern crate libc;\n\nfn main() {\n  //...\n  let pid = unsafe { libc::getpid() };\n  //...\n}\n\nOnce we have our pid, we will reuse the code from the last example to get the last core where we want to bind the process to:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\nfn main() {\n  //...\n  let mut cpuset = last_core(&mut topo).cpuset().unwrap();\n  //...\n}\n\n/// Find the last core\nfn last_core(topo: &mut Topology) -> &TopologyObject {\n    let core_depth = topo.depth_or_below_for_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap();\n    let all_cores = topo.objects_at_depth(core_depth);\n    all_cores.last().unwrap()\n}\n\nNow we can use the same methods as previously, but with the for_process() suffix. Here is the full example, again with some debug print statements to visualise what\u2019s going on:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n\n\nextern crate hwloc;\nextern crate libc;\n\nuse hwloc::{Topology, CPUBIND_PROCESS, TopologyObject, ObjectType};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut topo = Topology::new();\n\n    let pid = unsafe { libc::getpid() };\n    println!(\"Binding Process with PID {:?}\", pid);\n\n    let mut cpuset = last_core(&mut topo).cpuset().unwrap();\n    cpuset.singlify();\n\n    println!(\"Before Bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpubind_for_process(pid, CPUBIND_PROCESS).unwrap());\n    println!(\"Last Known CPU Location: {:?}\", topo.get_cpu_location_for_process(pid, CPUBIND_PROCESS).unwrap());\n\n    topo.set_cpubind_for_process(pid, cpuset, CPUBIND_PROCESS).unwrap();\n\n    println!(\"After Bind: {:?}\", topo.get_cpubind_for_process(pid, CPUBIND_PROCESS).unwrap());\n    println!(\"Last Known CPU Location: {:?}\", topo.get_cpu_location_for_process(pid, CPUBIND_PROCESS).unwrap());\n}\n\n/// Find the last core\nfn last_core(topo: &mut Topology) -> &TopologyObject {\n    let core_depth = topo.depth_or_below_for_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap();\n    let all_cores = topo.objects_at_depth(core_depth);\n    all_cores.last().unwrap()\n}\n\nIf we run this on our linux box, this is the output:\nBinding Process with PID 3034\nBefore Bind: 0-3\nLast Known CPU Location: 3\nAfter Bind: 3\nLast Known CPU Location: 3\nSo as long as you have the process ID available and the operating system supports it, you can bind every process to any number of cores you want. This is especially helpful if you need to bind forked processes or if you need to write some kind of babysitter service that needs to keep track and orchestrate a number of processes.\nThread Binding\nIn addition to bind the process as a whole, it is also possible to pin individual threads inside a process to cores. Every thread has a unique thread ID (tid) which is used to bind a thread to a core.\nThe following example will spawn one thread for each core in the system and then bind each thread to one of the cores. Here is the full code in its beauty, we\u2019ll break it apart afterwards:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n\n\nextern crate hwloc;\nextern crate libc;\n\nuse hwloc::{Topology, ObjectType, CPUBIND_THREAD, CpuSet};\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::sync::{Arc,Mutex};\n\nfn main() {\n    let topo = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Topology::new()));\n\n    let num_cores = {\n        let topo_rc = topo.clone();\n        let topo_locked = topo_rc.lock().unwrap();\n        (*topo_locked).objects_with_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap().len()\n    };\n    println!(\"Found {} cores.\", num_cores);\n\n    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..num_cores).map(|i| {\n            let child_topo = topo.clone();\n            thread::spawn(move || {\n                let tid = unsafe { libc::pthread_self() };\n                let mut locked_topo = child_topo.lock().unwrap();\n\n                let before = locked_topo.get_cpubind_for_thread(tid, CPUBIND_THREAD);\n\n                let bind_to = cpuset_for_core(&*locked_topo, i);\n\n                locked_topo.set_cpubind_for_thread(tid, bind_to, CPUBIND_THREAD).unwrap();\n\n                let after = locked_topo.get_cpubind_for_thread(tid, CPUBIND_THREAD);\n\n                println!(\"Thread {}: Before {:?}, After {:?}\", i, before, after);\n            })\n        }).collect();\n\n        for h in handles {\n            h.join().unwrap();\n        }\n}\n\nfn cpuset_for_core(topology: &Topology, idx: usize) -> CpuSet {\n    let cores = (*topology).objects_with_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap();\n    match cores.get(idx) {\n        Some(val) => val.cpuset().unwrap(),\n        None => panic!(\"No Core found with id {}\", idx)\n    }\n}\n\nBefore the binding we need to identify the number of cores - that\u2019s an easy task for hwloc:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nlet num_cores = {\n    let topo_rc = topo.clone();\n    let topo_locked = topo_rc.lock().unwrap();\n    (*topo_locked).objects_with_type(&ObjectType::Core).unwrap().len()\n};\nprintln!(\"Found {} cores.\", num_cores);\n\nThe code finds all cores through objects_with_type(&ObjectType::Core) and counts them. Note that we need to do use proper rust synchronization mechanisms around our Topology since we are accessing it from multiple threads in the code.\nThe next piece spawns one thread for each core and joins on the main thread to wait until they complete:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n\n\nlet handles: Vec<_> = (0..num_cores).map(|i| {\n        let child_topo = topo.clone();\n        thread::spawn(move || {\n            // do our other stuff\n        })\n    }).collect();\n\n    for h in handles {\n        h.join().unwrap();\n    }\n\nNext up we load the current thread ID through some libc unsafe magic, lock the Topology for safety and then read the current CpuSet for the thread (to print it out later):\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nlet tid = unsafe { libc::pthread_self() };\nlet mut locked_topo = child_topo.lock().unwrap();\n\nlet before = locked_topo.get_cpubind_for_thread(tid, CPUBIND_THREAD);\n\n\nThe next part is important:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nlet bind_to = cpuset_for_core(&*locked_topo, i);\n\nlocked_topo.set_cpubind_for_thread(tid, bind_to, CPUBIND_THREAD).unwrap();\n\nThe helper function cpuset_for_core accepts an integer which represents the thread number (not the tid) and loops through the cores available on the Topology. It then returns the right CpuSet for the given index, so the first thread will be pinned to Core 0, the second one to Core 1 and so forth. Then, we use the set_cpubind_for_thread() method to bass in the current thread id as well as the CpuSet to apply and the CPUBIND_THREAD identifier which is needed.\nFinally we just collect the new binding and then print it out for visualisation:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nlet after = locked_topo.get_cpubind_for_thread(tid, CPUBIND_THREAD);\n\nprintln!(\"Thread {}: Before {:?}, After {:?}\", i, before, after);\n\nRunning this on our 4-core machine prints:\nFound 4 cores.\nThread 0: Before Some(0-3), After Some(0)\nThread 1: Before Some(0-3), After Some(1)\nThread 2: Before Some(0-3), After Some(2)\nThread 3: Before Some(0-3), After Some(3)\nConclusion\nWhich processes or threads to bind is purely an application concern, but the underlying mechanics are greatly simplified through the hwloc abstractions. Combining the topology discovery with the CPU binding support allows you to choose the most optimised deployment option at runtime and giving you reasonable fallback options if the most performant way is not supported on the target.\nLooking ahead, the rust binding is pretty much complete on discovery and CPU binding (modulo some advanced APIs that are yet to come), but the big piece missing is memory binding. Since rust itself pretty much abstracts the whole memory management story, it\u2019s not as easy as exposing the custom memory allocation functions of hwloc. I\u2019m currently trying to wrap my head around good abstractions for this, so every input is very much appreciated! Please also let me know of any bugs you find or enhancements/clarifications you\u2019d like to see in the rust binding.\n\n    ",

I wanted to believe in the utopian ideal that hard work, discipline, and contributions were the fuel that propelled you up the corporate ladder. Boy, was I wrong. \n  You see, I started my career as a shy, insecure, but smart, programmer. I worked hard (almost every weekend), I wrote code for fun when I wasn't working on my work projects (still do, actually), and I was loyal and dedicated to my company. \n  My project should have been judged on merit \n  Once, for six months I worked on a project with four other people\u2014and I felt like my contributions in terms of functionality and hours contributed were at the top of the group. So you can imagine my surprise when at our launch party, the GM of the group stood up and recognized \"Josh and the other team members for their hard work.\" I stood there stunned, thinking, WTF?! How was it that the GM was so out of touch with the team? Didn't our manager look at the check-ins and the problems being resolved? How did Josh, who had probably contributed the second-least amount to the project, end up being the only person singled out from the group? Not me, not the most senior person on the project, but the guy who seemed to spend a lot of time talking to my boss and the other people on the project. \n  Many of us have been there, though. We work tirelessly, doing our very best to get things done on time, but somehow we get passed over\u2014in favor of someone else whom you honestly believe didn't contribute nearly as much as you did. What happened to meritocracy and being recognized for your work? \n  Autonomy makes meritocracy impossible \n  Fast forward to the present day. I work with a team of 18 amazing technologists, and it is my job to judge their performance. Only recently have I realized that in many ways it is nearly impossible to do so. \n  There is no objective, quantifiable way of doing this at scale without resorting to micromanagement\u2014which is not something you even want to contemplate with a talented team. If this doesn't make sense to you, then let me describe various metrics people have suggested for judging performance (note that some of these are measurable, but others are more subjective): \n  \u2022 Hours. Ugh. I hate hour watchers. Writing code, at least for me, is like art, and when I am just not in the mood I can't force myself to get things done. To use time spent as a productivity measure doesn't fairly represent the creativity and mentation required of a developer. Beyond that, it's not really all that feasible to track hours in a highly virtual environment. I love that people on my team can work from home\u2014or whatever environment where they do their best work (this is the reason we have \"no meeting\" days)\u2014but how can I possibly track someone's hours if they aren't in the office? Just like beans, counting hours sucks. Don't do it. \n  \u2022 Lines of code. This measure is flawed for many reasons\u2014from the mantra that \"the best code is the lines you don't write\" to the simple anecdotal fact that it once took me three days to write a single line of code, while another day I wrote more than 10,000 lines of code (although, admittedly, part of that count included some substantial cut and paste). And, of course, deleting code can be very productive, too. \n  \u2022 Bug counts. Quality is obviously important, but finding bugs in production belonging to developers who otherwise write great code is not rare. This metric is seriously flawed in a profound way\u2014it does not take into account that your best developers often produce a moderate number of serious bugs because they have been entrusted to design and implement the most complicated and critical pieces of an application/system. Penalizing your best players for having highly impacting bugs is tantamount to rewarding mediocrity. \n  \u2022 Features. Functionality is key, since when it comes to contributions, the features that are built into or added to the product should be directly tied to customer value. Of course, judging on features can get complicated when multiple people contribute to one feature. Further, the details of the implementation can dramatically affect the effort and hours involved. For example, consider a recent project to add login to an existing site: implementing the feature using interstitial pages would have taken a few hours; however, the design involved using lightboxes, which increased the complexity around security and added days to the project to accommodate. Even looking at functionality and features as a performance metric can be misleading if you don't dive into the technical details of the implementation and its tradeoffs. \n  \u2022 Maintainability. It is hard to measure and track something as subjective as writing solid, maintainable code\u2014but anyone who has had to struggle with legacy spaghetti code will tell you that maintainability is worth the extra time for code that will involve long-term usage in production. Coders who spend the extra time to write highly robust, maintainable code are often penalized for it, simply because their true contributions will not be realized until years later. \n  \u2022 Building skills and knowledge. How do you measure the benefit of the time invested in learning a new technology well enough to use it effectively; or researching and choosing the proper tools to optimize your productivity; or making careful and deliberate strategic choices that ultimately make a project feasible and successful? Obviously, these are critically important steps to take, but an outside perspective might point out that a lot more work could have been accomplished in the same amount of time spent developing skills and acquiring knowledge. \n  \u2022 Helping others. Many programmers are great, not for the work they do but for the way they enable others to be great. Just having these people on the team makes everyone else better. Mentoring and selfless assistance to others are critical to building and preserving a highly productive and cohesive team, but quantifying an individual's role in such activities can be incredibly difficult, despite the reality of the contribution. \n  There are probably 101 more factors that could be used to judge programmers' achievements\u2014including the way they present themselves (having a good attitude, for example), how dependable they are, or how often they contribute innovative ideas and solutions. Very few of these are objective, concrete factors that can be totaled up and given a grade\u2014and it is difficult to do so without diving into minute details or micromanaging a project. \n  THEN how do you get noticed? \n  If there's no reliable managerial measure of your contributions, how do you get noticed? Really it all comes down to one thing: trust. \n  Trust is like a currency. When managers give their team members autonomy and independence, they are trusting them to complete the assigned task, making wise and strategic decisions along the way, while proactively communicating problems long before they become problems. These managers are, in fact, investing their money in the team, and when they see the returns on that investment, they, just like any lucky investor, are quite pleased.  \n  Trust, though, takes time, patience, and consistency. If you can't build a relationship with your manager, all that work means nothing. For someone to invest in you, you have to show you are, in fact, an investment. Ask yourself these questions: \n  \u2022 Does your boss trust you? \n  \u2022 Do your team and your peers trust you? \n  \u2022 Have you done a good job to earn their trust? \n  \u2022 How would your peers describe you to someone else? \n  \u2022 How influential are you within your organization? \n  As a manager, I have been, at various times, very fond of a particular employee, but then noticed that this person's peers didn't care for him or her, or they held negative impressions of his or her performance. In these cases, given the trust level I have with my entire team, the opinions of the collective can easily outweigh personal preferences. Think of trust as a graph and each arc between the people you interact with as a weight\u2014so when it comes to performance, those weights really matter. \n  Projects, products, performance, and companies aren't just judged on their output, but on how they produce the output. \n  In the example project I began this article with, the one thing Josh did differently was that he didn't just do the work, but he also made sure that the management\u2014my boss and the GM\u2014knew what our team was doing. In retrospect, he was the reason our project was singled out in an organization with so many people. At the time, I resented Josh; but now, many years later, I realize that his contributions to our team weren't just his code, but also his communication skills and the way he did his job. \n  As an aside, though, certain company cultures may reward Josh's approach more than others. The problem with some people like Josh is that over time they can optimize on \"trust\" and create a distorted view of their contributions. This is what I mean when I say \"office politics\"\u2014and this isn't good, either. \n  One of my very smart friends told me a story about joining one big company and meeting tons of super-smart, highly functional, and productive people who were all about creating trust with their superiors by being hyper-visible: \n  \"They talked the most at meetings, they interrupted people, they sent extremely verbose emails at 3 a.m. detailing the minutia of a meeting that took place the previous day, they cc'd long lists of seemingly irrelevant but high-ranking people on their emails, etc. And their bosses loved them and they got the best reviews, etc. After meeting these individuals and being both amazed and disgusted by their shtick, it started to become clear to us that the whole culture self-selects to this type of person. It didn't take us long to understand why so much \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwork' happens but so little gets done.\" \n  What can you do AS a manager? \n  As an employee, I want to be judged by my contributions and be part of a team that is a meritocracy. I also want autonomy and the ability to own substantial parts of a project and not have someone looking over my shoulder. \n  As a manager, I want to give recognition and praise to the people who deserve it, and I don't want to micromanage and spend my days being big brother. \n  This implies an implicit contract: \n  I will give you autonomy and independence, but it is your responsibility to share status and information with me. \n  For example, a team member once told me he had worked so hard and had really given it his best; from my viewpoint, however, his progress wasn't up to the level of his teammates. When he was leaving the company, he told me all these things he had done, and I asked him, \"Why didn't you share this with me before?\" With that information I could have advised him to spend his time elsewhere on priorities that were more important to the business. His response: \"I thought you would know.\" Don't make that mistake. \n  It is also important that as a manager you recognize improvement. This means understanding a person's strengths and weaknesses. If you observe someone's performance and see substantial improvements in one of that person's development areas, then that is definitely worth recognizing. For example, if you have an amazing engineer who is typically a poor communicator, but who then steps up and contributes not just great coding prowess to a project but also keeps other team members abreast of evolving risk factors, those sorts of achievements are worth praise. \n  Make sure you consider all the factors of a person's involvement in the organization. Take steps to ask good questions and solicit feedback from other members of the organization. Finally, let each person know your expectations around communication and progress. \n  And what can YOU do now? \n  My conclusion from all of this is this: if you want autonomy and the ability to own and control your own domain and projects, then it is your job to push information and build trust with your team members. \n  In other words, you need to learn and do the following: \n  \u2022 Follow through. Do what you say, and consistently deliver on your commitments. \n  \u2022 Proactively communicate. When a task takes longer than you thought, explain why. \n  \u2022 Improve your communication skills. In order for others to hear you, sometimes you have to hone the way you deliver your message. \n  \u2022 Volunteer information. Make an effort to explain vague or hard-to-understand ideas and concepts. Share the details of your decisions and diversions. This is also important when you make mistakes\u2014letting others know before they figure it out on their own will show ownership of the situation and can prevent misunderstandings later. \n  \u2022 Be forthright and authentic with your feelings. Even when you may hold a contrary opinion, communicate your thoughts (respectfully and with tact). \n  \u2022 Don't talk behind the backs of others. It is very difficult to build trust if someone knows that you will say something negative about your boss, the company leadership, or another coworker. \n  \u2022 Be objective and neutral in difficult situations. Learn how to be calm under pressure, and act as a diplomat resolving conflicts instead of causing them. \n  \u2022 Show consistency in your behavior. This is important not only in follow-through but also in eliminating any double standards that may exist. \n  \u2022 Learn to trust your team members. This is one of the hardest goals to accomplish, but trust is a two-way street. Giving others the benefit of the doubt and learning how to work with them is essential to a strong mutual working relationship. \n  In turn, you may be lucky enough to have a good manager who will be able to ask you good questions and take the time to understand your contributions. If that is not your situation, then make sure you are sharing information with those around you, such as your peers, your boss, and other stakeholders. \n  Good leadership means keeping everyone on the same page. If you want independence, then it is on you to make sure people know what you are contributing. \n  Kate Matsudaira is an experienced technology leader.

Lots of criteria exist for cryptographic hashes motivated by various security requirements, but on the non-cryptographic side there is a certain amount of folklore that, despite the long history of hash functions, has not been fully explored. While targeting a uniform distribution makes a lot of sense for real-world datasets, it can be a challenge when confronted by a dataset with particular patterns.\n\t  \n\t  \n\n\t  \n\t  Nicole Forsgren, Eirini Kalliamvakou, Abi Noda, Michaela Greiler, Brian Houck, Margaret-Anne Storey - DevEx in Action\n\t  \n\t  DevEx (developer experience) is garnering increased attention at many software organizations as leaders seek to optimize software delivery amid the backdrop of fiscal tightening and transformational technologies such as AI. Intuitively, there is acceptance among technical leaders that good developer experience enables more effective software delivery and developer happiness. Yet, at many organizations, proposed initiatives and investments to improve DevEx struggle to get buy-in as business stakeholders question the value proposition of improvements.\n\t  \n\t  \n\n\t  \n\t  Jo\u00e3o Varaj\u00e3o, Ant\u00f3nio Trigo, Miguel Almeida - Low-code Development Productivity\n\t  \n\t  This article aims to provide new insights on the subject by presenting the results of laboratory experiments carried out with code-based, low-code, and extreme low-code technologies to study differences in productivity. Low-code technologies have clearly shown higher levels of productivity, providing strong arguments for low-code to dominate the software development mainstream in the short/medium term.

In its haste for fast-forward motion, it is subject to the whims of fashion and can forget or ignore proven solutions to some of the eternal problems that it faces. Use cases, first introduced in 1986 and popularized later, are one of those proven solutions.\n\t  \n\t  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\u00a9 ACM, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\t\n\n",

    "scraped_body": "The hope is to facilitate communication in emergency situations in particular, such as at a doctor\u2019s office or hospital, without relying on written communication or, as some other sign-language-recognition research has done, using cameras to recognize sign-language gestures. A paper on the work will be presented at an intelligent user interfaces conference in March.Researchers relied on the Myo armbands to make Sceptre work because they include both an inertial measurement unit for tracking motion and electromyography sensors for muscle sensing, which can be used to help determine finger configurations. They trained software to recognize a variety of ASL gestures, as well as the signs for individual letters and the numbers one through 10, all performed by someone wearing the Myo armbands.\n Sceptre, a research project that translates sign language as text using Myo armbands, could be made to work with a computer or a smartphone. After having users train their software on 20 different ASL gestures like \u201cpizza,\u201d \u201chappy,\u201d and \u201corange\u201d by repeating each of them three times, the researchers found Sceptre was then able to decipher the sign correctly nearly 98 percent of the time.In a video demonstrating how it works, Prajwal Paudyal, a graduate student at Arizona State University who coauthored the paper, wears the armbands and signs several different things that are then illustrated on a computer display, like \u201call morning,\u201d \u201cheadache,\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t sleep.\u201d\nThough the signs were shown as text in the study, they could also be spoken aloud by an app to facilitate a conversation, Paudyal says. And while the researchers\u2019 demo showed the text on a computer\u2019s display, which the Myo armbands connected to via Bluetooth, Sceptre could also be used with just a smartphone\u2014something the researchers are also working on (Myo supports streaming data from two wristbands to one smartphone, but the researchers say this wasn\u2019t possible when they conducted their initial work).\u00a0 \u201cIdeally, the person can use this anywhere they go,\u201d Paudyal says. Sceptre, an Arizona State University research project, uses two Myo armbands to translate sign language as text. Roozbeh\u00a0Jafari, an associate professor at Texas A&M\u2019s Center for Remote Healthcare Technologies and Systems, has done similar work, though it involved building the sensors rather than using off-the-shelf devices as the ASU group did.He says there are a number of issues that would have to be solved to make something like Sceptre work for consumers. Typically, when you place electromyography sensors on the body, the system using them has to be calibrated unless they\u2019re in the exact same location they were in previously, he says. There\u2019s also a need to account for variations that naturally occur in the ways people sign the same things. Despite these obstacles, he says, \u201cI think we are moving in the right direction.\u201d ",

The district, which serves roughly 1,600 students, is one of the poorer areas in the state, with a per capita income of just over $15,000. \"We\u2019re looking at close to three-quarters of our kids [who] are classified as economically disadvantaged here,\" said Kris Kirby, the district\u2019s assistant superintendent. So when it came time to find computer equipment for every classroom, Ovid-Elsie had to get creative. The school was eager to experiment with Google Chromebooks, which have been sweeping the education market. But even those machines cost several hundred dollars each, far too much for Ovid-Elsie to afford one for every student. Dan Davenport, the director of technology for the area schools, had looked into using Chromium, the open-source version of Google\u2019s Chrome operating system, but was stymied by the complexity of supporting a range of different drivers on a mishmash of old computers. Then one of Davenport\u2019s techs, reading through a forum posting on Chromium, came across a New York City startup called Neverware. The company claimed to have done the legwork of adapting Chromium to work with old PCs. It would help with the task of converting the legacy machines and assist with ongoing support. Davenport had amassed what he lovingly refers to as a junk pile inside a storage room at one of his schools. \"We haven\u2019t even gotten rid of what you might consider obsolete machines. So we just have them stacked up.\" Davenport decided to give Neverware a try. For the most part, Davenport\u2019s repository consisted of eight- to 10-year-old Dell desktops and laptops he had robbed of RAM and other components to help speed up or repair machines used by teachers. \"We are left with these mismatched parts.\" And yet, when he set the machines up to run Neverware\u2019s Cloud Ready version of Chromium, they outperformed newer Windows machines the school was using. \"If you are comparing what we used to run, Chrome and Neverware is a better experience for the end user.\" Davenport estimates that to get a new machine and the proper license, it would cost around $400 for each new Windows computer and $200 for each new Chromebook. \"With Neverware it\u2019s costing me 50 bucks.\" The school is now adapting several computer labs to run Neverware chromebooks. \"Hey, that\u2019s an interesting model,\" says Davenport with a chuckle. \"Run on your oldest junk for next to no money.\" The transformation at Ovid-Elsie is striking, but far from unique. It\u2019s just one example of a much larger trend toward cloud computing, a paradigm shift that has radically reshaped the technological landscape at schools across the United States.  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n Students finish up projects in a mid-morning class at the Academy for Software Engineering, a public school in lower Manhattan that\u2019s adopted Chromebook laptops and uses Neverware.  Though the sale of personal computers has been in decline over the last four years, in the education market the appetite for computers has actually increased. According to market research firm IDC, K-12 schools in the US spent $7 billion on tablets, desktop, laptop, and two-in-one computers in 2014, with unit sales growing 33 percent from the year prior. For decades, this massive market has been dominated by two players, Apple and Microsoft. Before 2012, Google was a non-entity in the market. But that year it began trying to sell schools on the idea of using Chromebooks: low-cost laptops with limited hardware that relied on the cloud for software and storage. The approach allowed schools to cut both cost and complexity, with Google managing a lot of the IT work \u2014 security, storage, and software updates. And it has been a wild success. Microsoft still has a far larger install base, but by 2014 Chromebooks were the best selling device in K-12 schools in the US. In the third quarter of 2015, Google\u2019s Chromebooks started outselling all other devices combined. Google\u2019s success was driven by what Mike Fisher, an associate director with Futuresource Consulting specializing in educational technology, calls \"a perfect storm.\" The common curriculum, pushed along by the Obama administration, came with federal grants to introduce online assessment, a switch that created a surge of demand for computers in schools. Keyboards were required for testing, making tablets less appealing. And Google\u2019s cloud software was a cut above the competition. \"For a district rolling out 30,000 new devices you want to manage from the cloud, [Google] had a much more compelling offering,\" says Fisher. The low-cost hardware was easy for school districts with tight budgets to appreciate, but the total savings went beyond the initial purchase. \"Schools are all trying to get more hardware into the hands of students, and what they\u2019re discovering is using a Chromebook and the Google infrastructure, the total cost of ownership is 70 percent lower then iOS or Windows,\" says Ted Brodheim, who oversees education sales for Samsung, and helped forge a partnership with Neverware. \"The cost of managing these complex systems that were really designed for very large enterprises, it just doesn\u2019t lend itself to the school environment as well as Chrome does.\" While the economic benefits to schools are now clear, Brodheim says many districts are still passing on Chrome because they are afraid of the switching costs. \"They are already struggling to maintain their legacy infrastructure [and] can\u2019t afford to replace every device.\" That\u2019s where Neverware comes in.  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  Founded in 2009 by Jonathan Hefter, Neverware began as an experiment in his parents' garage, resurrecting old machines and seeing if he could get them to run like new. Hefter had gotten a taste of a technology called desktop virtualization while interning at a Wall Street firm during college. It made personal computers into terminals all powered by a central hub. He was keen to bring this model to schools and nonprofits, and began working on ways to simplify the technology. By 2012, Neverware was a small, seven-person startup with a few million dollars in venture capital funding and its first pilot programs running in a handful of public schools. It would install a custom server, dubbed the \"Juicebox,\" as the brains of the entire system. The individual computers become \"thin clients,\" essentially dumb screens powered by Neverware\u2019s Juicebox. A workstation could continue to operate, even with its hard drive removed. This allowed schools to make use of clunkers that had long ago stopped performing well enough to be worth handing to students. It also let schools offload a lot of the IT work happening in the background to Neverware, which could handle it remotely in the cloud. Neverware\u2019s early partners praised the service, but the rapid rise of Chromebooks undercut its offering. True, schools were embracing Neverware\u2019s approach \u2014 lightweight machines supported mostly through the cloud \u2014 but the startup was no match for the pricing and support Google could offer, much less its suite of educational apps and management tools. \"We knew we had to adapt or die,\" says Hefter. And so the team changed its strategy. It still focused on taking old machines and refurbishing them as cloud-connected computers, but it would put Google\u2019s Chrome operating system at the center of its business. Google and hardware partners like Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, and Intel, are the only companies authorized to sell official \"Chromebooks.\" But Google maintains an open-source version of its operating system called Chromium, that it encourages developers to build on. Neverware spent 10 months developing a version of Chromium that could handle Google\u2019s newest apps, but would run on drivers from dozens of older, commonly used Windows PCs. The result was CloudReady, software which Neverware now sells to schools, charging $59 for a lifetime license or $25 per year for schools not ready to commit. Hefter says Neverware has deployments at 250 school districts so far, with hundreds more currently trialling the software. The machines may not technically be \"Chromebooks\u2122,\" but for schools, they function just like them, and the educators and IT staff all used that name. Neverware\u2019s success at turning old machines into high-performing \"Chromebooks\" illustrates a great irony of the cloud computing age. Many of the machines that schools had put out to pasture because they were so old and slow are actually far more powerful, in terms of raw hardware, than the brand new Chromebooks\u2122 being brought to market.  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n After the bell rings, high schoolers at the Academy for Software Engineering return their laptops to the storage box. Since all students work is saved in Google Drive, students can access their work from any available computer.  Google\u2019s rise in the education market represents an annoyance to Apple, for whom Mac and iPad sales to schools are important, but not essential. For Microsoft, which has definitely lost the smartphone wars, and relies on schools as a critical customer, it\u2019s a far more serious threat. To fight back, Microsoft made an online version of its Office 365 apps free to students, and in October of 2015, it partnered with Lightspeed to roll out a bundle aimed at competing with the cloud-managed suite of Google\u2019s education package. In January of this year, Apple made a similar move by acquiring a startup called LearnSprout, and has built out the cloud management and provisioning capabilities of iOS with a focus on education in its latest update. Microsoft has also worked with partners like HP, Acer, and Lenovo to introduce cloud-based laptops with limited storage that can match up to Chromebooks on cost. But schools may not be the only customers Microsoft needs to worry about, as lightweight cloud-based computing begins to find traction with cost-conscious startups and nonprofits. Marc Dantona is the head of IT at Kiva, a San Francisco startup that facilitates micro-loans to small business owners in the developing world. As one man trying to manage computers for 110 employees on four different continents, Dantona was attracted to the fact that putting his employees on Chrome meant Google would handle a lot of the background work of security, stability, and storage. Plus, he was on a tight budget. So Dantona decided to look into Neverware. He installed it on a pile of laptops he had long ago discarded as junk. \"I\u2019ve got these Lenovo machines, and actually for Chrome they\u2019re Corvettes,\" he says with delight. \"They\u2019ve got four gigs of ram, they\u2019ve got these huge processors in them, and they are battle axes, you can throw these things out of a moving car and get them to work.\" Being able to resurrect old hardware on the cheap, and relying on Google\u2019s cloud for apps, syncing, and data storage, makes repairs much simpler. \"If you have a $1,500 Macbook Air and you spill your $7 latte on it, not only do I have to deal with protecting the hardware, but it\u2019s actually the time it takes for me to try and get your data off of there. If I could just hand you an identical piece of hardware and tell you to log in and you can go back to work in minutes while your stuff synchronizes?\" His voice rises with the impassioned agitation of a 15-year IT veteran: \"It seems like a no brainer.\" So far, Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the private sector has not been disrupted the way it has in education. Google has 50 million customers using its suite of educations apps, and more than 2 million customers with its Google Apps for Work products. Jessica Reeves, a Google spokeswoman says that while adoption of Chromebooks in business is still relatively low, \"it\u2019s definitely gathering speed.\" \"We have begun to open discussion with folks in the health care and retail space. We are just beginning to start those conversations, but I can\u2019t point to serious traction there,\" says Samsung\u2019s Brodheim. \"My own personal belief is that as they begin to understand Chrome and the benefits, they will make the move, much the same way you saw in education. Five years ago, Chrome had almost no presence. Now it is outselling the other devices. There is an adoption curve.\" Kiva\u2019s Dantona agrees. \"There\u2019s a perception of the employees that the Chromebooks aren\u2019t good. That\u2019s a struggle.\" He is incredulous of the way his fellow Silicon Valley startups seem to think of Macbooks as part of a hiring process. \"You look at Craigslist or LinkedIn at jobs, and some of the cheesier startups will like say, \u2018We give you free food and all the granola bars you could ever dream of and a Macbook Pro.\" He grunts in disgust, \"They see it as a perk. I see it as a waste.\" He thinks Chromebooks will start at nonprofits and small startups like Kiva, then trickle out. \"I don\u2019t think the management knows the cost savings yet. Once the CFOs wake up \u2014 especially at big enterprises where the numbers are huge \u2014 and realize the cost savings in terms of personnel time, they are going to insist on it.\"  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  At the Academy for Software Engineering in New York City, the school\u2019s first graduating class is getting ready to head off to college. Teenagers squirm in their seats as their teacher walks them through a hypothetical scenario about a freshman who isn\u2019t fitting in. He then asks the class to sit down at their computers and write out a plan for an upcoming lesson. AFSE is focused on equipping its students with high-tech skills that will lead to rewarding careers in the future. But when it comes to managing its own technological infrastructure, it\u2019s just another public school with limited budget and resources. \"The Department of Education can offer resources like computers. But they don\u2019t offer any help when it comes to managing our scaling that infrastructure, how to roll out technology in a meaningful way,\" says Yvonne Williams, the school\u2019s business manager. \"We started off 2012 with two sets of Macbooks and no real plan for how we were going to implement technology in a sustainable, scalable way.\" After Macbooks, AFSE tried Windows, buying a batch of Lenovo laptops. But the ongoing cost of managing and maintaining those machines convinced the administration to switch to Google Apps. The decision was made much easier when they learned that Neverware could convert their old PCs to run as Chromebooks. \"In a one-hour class, it sometimes took the Windows machines 10, 15 minutes just to boot up,\" says David Yang, the school\u2019s IT manager. \"With Chrome, we can minimize the unnecessary functionality in the background and get a lot more computer time in class.\" Today Neverware announced a feature it believes will make it even easier for schools and businesses to start experimenting with Google Apps and Chrome. Windows machines running its CloudReady software will now be able to boot into either Chromium or Windows. \"We think this is going to make it a lot easier for folks who are \u2018Chrome Curious\u2019 to start giving it a try,\" says Hefter, the company\u2019s CEO. It has also devised a version of its software that will convert old Macs to work with Chromium, although it hasn\u2019t had as much interest in that yet. Hypothetically the dual boot feature is a great fallback for schools like AFSE, where spotty connectivity means the Chromebooks can\u2019t always connect to the internet. I asked Williams if she thought AFSE might use their old Lenovos as laptops when the internet was down, or if the ongoing connectivity issues had ever made her regret choosing Google. Did she ever think about going to Mac or PC? \"It just doesn\u2019t fit with our long-term vision,\" she said. The amount of IT work the school has been able to shift to Google was \"invaluable.\" And with Neverware, having enough hardware was no longer a serious concern. Plus, said Williams, \"All our students are very familiar with Gmail and Google Drive.\" Beyond the sales cycles, the cloud management tools, and the billions at stake selling to US schools, the biggest thing Apple and Microsoft stand to lose as Google Chrome marches toward dominance in the education market may be mindshare, the future loyalty of millions of students who work on whatever machine their teachers give them. As the lesson wound down and I prepared to leave, Williams asked who in the class planned to keep using Google Apps once they got to college. Every single hand went up. One aspiring computer science major did take the opportunity to play class clown. \"Unless I invent something better!\"  * * Edited by Michael Zelenko    ",

    "scraped_body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAt\u00a0the core of the\u00a0heated public\u00a0debate over\u00a0Apple\u2019s refusal to help the FBI decrypt an iPhone belonging to one of the suspects in the recent terror attack in San Bernardino\u00a0is one key question: whether the company can crack the phone's security without compromising the security of its encryption technology on a broad scale.The answer, it turns out, in this particular case is a qualified \u2018yes.'Many cybersecurity experts say that older iPhones such as the one the FBI recovered from the\u00a0San Bernardino terrorist attack \u2013 and wants Apple's help to unlock \u2013 are already hackable. And that software\u00a0Apple is being asked to write for breaking\u00a0into the phone recovered by the FBI would be unlikely to compromise the newer, more secure later models.However, experts stress,\u00a0just because Apple could hack these phones doesn't mean they should.Apple CEO Tim Cook has claimed that if the company were to comply with Tuesday's\u00a0order from a magistrate judge and somehow create software for unlocking the specific phone, it would be giving the government the potential to unlock any iPhone.\u00a0In a passionate defense of Apple\u2019s stance, Mr. Cook compared the software Apple would need to develop, to a master key \u201ccapable of opening hundreds of millions of locks \u2013\u00a0from restaurants and banks to stores and homes.\u201dThe technical reality, say some security researchers, is somewhat more nuanced.The iPhone that the FBI wants Apple\u2019s help in decrypting is an iPhone 5C, a model released in 2013. The encryption on the phone is tied to the passcode that a user sets to lock and unlock the device. The phone has an auto-erase function that can be used to delete data after 10 failed attempts to log into the device using a passcode. The phone also features a passcode delay feature that forces the user to wait longer between guesses with every wrong guess.What the FBI and the US District Court for the Central District of California want Apple to do is to write software that would essentially override these protections,\u00a0and make it easier for authorities to run a program that could try potentially millions of combinations quickly to get into the phone by what's known as \"brute force.\"\u00a0Based on Apple's own description of\u00a0how its products work, the same software would not work on the company's newer iPhones,\u00a0which ties the passcode that a user enters to a unique key stored in a separate hardware component on the device.\u00a0\u201cThink of this like the 2-key system used to launch a nuclear weapon: the passcode alone gets you nowhere,\u201d said Dan Guido, co-founder and CEO of security firm Trail of Bits, writing on the company\u2019s blog. In order to decrypt contents on an iPhone featuring this technology, the FBI would need to\u00a0have a way\u00a0not just\u00a0to crack\u00a0the password but also to recover the second hardware key on the device, Mr. Guido said.However,\u00a0the\u00a0software that Apple is being asked to develop\u00a0would most likely work on an iPhone 5C of the kind that the government wants Apple\u2019s help in breaking into. That\u2019s because this model does not have the same level of protection against hacking that the newer models have.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhile the data is encrypted, the software controlling the phone is not,\u201d said noted cryptographer Bruce\u00a0Schneier in an opinion piece for The Washington Post. \u201cThis means that someone can create a hacked version of the software and install it on the phone without the consent of the phone\u2019s owner and without knowing the encryption key,\" Mr. Schneier said, which is precisely what the government wants Apple to do. \u00a0Though\u00a0there are some obstacles\u00a0overcome, Guido agrees it\u00a0is technically possible for Apple to\u00a0comply with the court\u2019s order\u00a0to unlock the iPhone 5C\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and to\u00a0prevent the FBI from exploiting the software\u00a0later\u00a0by locking\u00a0the software so it works only on the phone from the investigation,\u00a0and to perform all data recovery on its own.\u00a0But just because it's technically possible, the experts say, does not necessarily mean helping the feds crack the phone is the right decision for Apple.\u00a0The court wants Apple to load the new\u00a0software on the recovered device at a government facility \u2013 or provide the government with remote access to the device so it can decrypt the device.Either approach would amount to the government gaining access to a piece of software that at the very least would give it a way to unlock encrypted data on iPhone models similar to the one at the center of the case.\u00a0\"Make no mistake; this is what a backdoor looks like,\" Mr. Schneier noted.And that, as Apple has made clear, is something that it is not willing to enable, at least without fighting it out in court.\u00a0\"The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone\u2019s microphone or camera without your knowledge,\" Cook said.\"We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

    "scraped_body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tI am (or at least think I am) an expert. Not on everything, but in a particular area of human knowledge, specifically social science and public policy. When I say something on those subjects, I expect that my opinion holds more weight than that of most other people.\nI never thought those were particularly controversial statements. As it turns out, they\u2019re plenty controversial. Today, any assertion of expertise produces an explosion of anger from certain quarters of the American public, who immediately complain that such claims are nothing more than fallacious \u201cappeals to authority,\u201d sure signs of dreadful \u201celitism,\u201d and an obvious effort to use credentials to stifle the dialogue required by a \u201creal\u201d democracy.\nBut democracy, as I wrote in an essay about C.S. Lewis and the Snowden affair, denotes a system of government, not an actual state of equality. It means that we enjoy equal rights versus the government, and in relation to each other. Having equal rights does not mean having equal talents, equal abilities, or equal knowledge.\u00a0 It assuredly does not mean that \u201ceveryone\u2019s opinion about anything is as good as anyone else\u2019s.\u201d And yet, this is now enshrined as the credo of a fair number of people despite being obvious nonsense.\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nI fear we are witnessing the \u201cdeath of expertise\u201d: a Google-fueled, Wikipedia-based, blog-sodden collapse of any division between professionals and laymen, students and teachers, knowers and wonderers \u2013 in other words, between those of any achievement in an area and those with none at all. By this, I do not mean the death of actual expertise, the knowledge of specific things that sets some people apart from others in various areas. There will always be doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other specialists in various fields. Rather, what I fear has died is any acknowledgement of expertise as anything that should alter our thoughts or change the way we live.\nWhat has died is any acknowledgement of expertise as anything that should alter our thoughts or change the way we live.\nThis is a very bad thing. Yes, it\u2019s true that experts can make mistakes, as disasters from thalidomide to the Challenger explosion tragically remind us. But mostly, experts have a pretty good batting average compared to laymen: doctors, whatever their errors, seem to do better with most illnesses than faith healers or your Aunt Ginny and her special chicken gut poultice. To reject the notion of expertise, and to replace it with a sanctimonious insistence that every person has a right to his or her own opinion, is silly.\nWorse, it\u2019s dangerous. The death of expertise is a rejection not only of knowledge, but of the ways in which we gain knowledge and learn about things. Fundamentally, it\u2019s a rejection of science and rationality, which are the foundations of Western civilization itself. Yes, I said \u201cWestern civilization\u201d: that paternalistic, racist, ethnocentric approach to knowledge that created the nuclear bomb, the Edsel, and New Coke, but which also keeps diabetics alive, lands mammoth airliners in the dark, and writes documents like the Charter of the United Nations.\nThis isn\u2019t just about politics, which would be bad enough. No, it\u2019s worse than that: the perverse effect of the death of expertise is that without real experts, everyone is an expert on everything. To take but one horrifying example, we live today in an advanced post-industrial country that is now fighting a resurgence of whooping cough \u2014 a scourge nearly eliminated a century ago \u2014 merely because otherwise intelligent people have been second-guessing their doctors and refusing to vaccinate their kids after reading stuff written by people who know exactly zip about medicine. (Yes, I mean people like Jenny McCarthy.\nIn politics, too, the problem has reached ridiculous proportions. People in political debates no longer distinguish the phrase \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d from the phrase \u201cyou\u2019re stupid.\u201d To disagree is to insult. To correct another is to be a hater. And to refuse to acknowledge alternative views, no matter how fantastic or inane, is to be closed-minded.\nHow conversation became exhausting\nCritics might dismiss all this by saying that everyone has a right to participate in the public sphere. That\u2019s true. But every discussion must take place within limits and above a certain baseline of competence. And competence is sorely lacking in the public arena. People with strong views on going to war in other countries can barely find their own nation on a map; people who want to punish Congress for this or that law can\u2019t name their own member of the House.\nPeople with strong views on going to war in other countries can barely find their own nation on a map.\nNone of this ignorance stops people from arguing as though they are research scientists. Tackle a complex policy issue with a layman today, and you will get snippy and sophistic demands to show ever increasing amounts of \u201cproof\u201d or \u201cevidence\u201d for your case, even though the ordinary interlocutor in such debates isn\u2019t really equipped to decide what constitutes \u201cevidence\u201d or to know it when it\u2019s presented. The use of evidence is a specialized form of knowledge that takes a long time to learn, which is why articles and books are subjected to \u201cpeer review\u201d and not to \u201ceveryone review,\u201d but don\u2019t tell that to someone hectoring you about the how things really work in Moscow or Beijing or Washington.\nThis subverts any real hope of a conversation, because it is simply exhausting \u2014 at least speaking from my perspective as the policy expert in most of these discussions \u2014 to have to start from the very beginning of every argument and establish the merest baseline of knowledge, and then constantly to have to negotiate the rules of logical argument. (Most people I encounter, for example, have no idea what a non-sequitur is, or when they\u2019re using one; nor do they understand the difference between generalizations and stereotypes.) Most people are already huffy and offended before ever encountering the substance of the issue at hand.\nOnce upon a time \u2014 way back in the Dark Ages before the 2000s \u2014 people seemed to understand, in a general way, the difference between experts and laymen. There was a clear demarcation in political food fights, as objections and dissent among experts came from their peers \u2014 that is, from people equipped with similar knowledge. The public, largely, were spectators.\nThis was both good and bad. While it strained out the kook factor in discussions (editors controlled their letters pages, which today would be called \u201cmoderating\u201d), it also meant that sometimes public policy debate was too esoteric, conducted less for public enlightenment and more as just so much dueling jargon between experts.\nIf experts go back to only talking to each other, that\u2019s bad for democracy.\nNo one \u2014 not me, anyway \u2014 wants to return to those days. I like the 21st century, and I like the democratization of knowledge and the wider circle of public participation. That greater participation, however, is endangered by the utterly illogical insistence that every opinion should have equal weight, because people like me, sooner or later, are forced to tune out people who insist that we\u2019re all starting from intellectual scratch. (Spoiler: We\u2019re not.) And if that happens, experts will go back to only talking to each other. And that\u2019s bad for democracy.\nThe downside of no gatekeepers\nHow did this peevishness about expertise come about, and how can it have gotten so immensely foolish?\nSome of it is purely due to the globalization of communication. There are no longer any gatekeepers: the journals and op-ed pages that were once strictly edited have been drowned under the weight of self-publishable blogs. There was once a time when participation in public debate, even in the pages of the local newspaper, required submission of a letter or an article, and that submission had to be written intelligently, pass editorial review, and stand with the author\u2019s name attached. Even then, it was a big deal to get a letter in a major newspaper.\nNow, anyone can bum rush the comments section of any major publication. Sometimes, that results in a free-for-all that spurs better thinking. Most of the time, however, it means that anyone can post anything they want, under any anonymous cover, and never have to defend their views or get called out for being wrong.\nAnother reason for the collapse of expertise lies not with the global commons but with the increasingly partisan nature of U.S. political campaigns. There was once a time when presidents would win elections and then scour universities and think-tanks for a brain trust; that\u2019s how Henry Kissinger, Samuel Huntington, Zbigniew Brzezinski and others ended up in government service while moving between places like Harvard and Columbia.\nThis is the code of the samurai, not the intellectual, and it privileges the campaign loyalist over the expert.\nThose days are gone. To be sure, some of the blame rests with the increasing irrelevance of overly narrow research in the social sciences. But it is also because the primary requisite of seniority in the policy world is too often an answer to the question: \u201cWhat did you do during the campaign?\u201d This is the code of the samurai, not the intellectual, and it privileges the campaign loyalist over the expert.\nI have a hard time, for example, imagining that I would be called to Washington today in the way I was back in 1990, when the senior Senator from Pennsylvania asked a former U.S. Ambassador to the UN who she might recommend to advise him on foreign affairs, and she gave him my name. Despite the fact that I had no connection to Pennsylvania and had never worked on his campaigns, he called me at the campus where I was teaching, and later invited me to join his personal staff.\nUniversities, without doubt, have to own some of this mess. The idea of telling students that professors run the show and know better than they do strikes many students as something like uppity lip from the help, and so many profs don\u2019t do it. (One of the greatest teachers I ever had, James Schall, once wrote many years ago that \u201cstudents have obligations to teachers,\u201d including \u201ctrust, docility, effort, and thinking,\u201d an assertion that would produce howls of outrage from the entitled generations roaming campuses today.) As a result, many academic departments are boutiques, in which the professors are expected to be something like intellectual valets. This produces nothing but a delusion of intellectual adequacy in children who should be instructed, not catered to.\nThe confidence of the dumb\nThere\u2019s also that immutable problem known as \u201chuman nature.\u201d It has a name now: it\u2019s called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which says, in sum, that the dumber you are, the more confident you are that you\u2019re not actually dumb. And when you get invested in being aggressively dumb\u2026well, the last thing you want to encounter are experts who disagree with you, and so you dismiss them in order to maintain your unreasonably high opinion of yourself. (There\u2019s a lot of that loose on social media, especially.)\nAll of these are symptoms of the same disease: a manic reinterpretation of \u201cdemocracy\u201d in which everyone must have their say, and no one must be \u201cdisrespected.\u201d (The verb to disrespect is one of the most obnoxious and insidious innovations in our language in years, because it really means \u201cto fail to pay me the impossibly high requirement of respect I demand.\u201d) This yearning for respect and equality, even\u2014perhaps especially\u2014if unearned, is so intense that it brooks no disagreement. It represents the full flowering of a therapeutic culture where self-esteem, not achievement, is the ultimate human value, and it\u2019s making us all dumber by the day.\nThus, at least some of the people who reject expertise are not really, as they often claim, showing their independence of thought. They are instead rejecting anything that might stir a gnawing insecurity that their own opinion might not be worth all that much.\nExperts: the servants, not masters, of a democracy\nSo what can we do? Not much, sadly, since this is a cultural and generational issue that will take a long time come right, if it ever does. Personally, I don\u2019t think technocrats and intellectuals should rule the world: we had quite enough of that in the late 20th century, thank you, and it should be clear now that intellectualism makes for lousy policy without some sort of political common sense. Indeed, in an ideal world, experts are the servants, not the masters, of a democracy.\nBut when citizens forgo their basic obligation to learn enough to actually govern themselves, and instead remain stubbornly imprisoned by their fragile egos and caged by their own sense of entitlement, experts will end up running things by default. That\u2019s a terrible outcome for everyone.\nExpertise is necessary, and it\u2019s not going away. Unless we return it to a healthy role in public policy, we\u2019re going to have stupider and less productive arguments every day. So here, presented without modesty or political sensitivity, are some things to think about when engaging with experts in their area of specialization.\n\nWe can all stipulate: the expert isn\u2019t always right.\nBut an expert is far more likely to be right than you are. On a question of factual interpretation or evaluation, it shouldn\u2019t engender insecurity or anxiety to think that an expert\u2019s view is likely to be better-informed than yours. (Because, likely, it is.)\nExperts come in many flavors. Education enables it, but practitioners in a field acquire expertise through experience; usually the combination of the two is the mark of a true expert in a field. But if you have neither education nor experience, you might want to consider exactly what it is you\u2019re bringing to the argument.\nIn any discussion, you have a positive obligation to learn at least enough to make the conversation possible. The University of Google doesn\u2019t count. Remember: having a strong opinion about something isn\u2019t the same as knowing something.\nAnd yes, your political opinions have value. Of course they do: you\u2019re a member of a democracy and what you want is as important as what any other voter wants. As a layman, however, your political analysis, has far less value, and probably isn\u2019t \u2014 indeed, almost certainly isn\u2019t \u2014 as good as you think it is.\n\nAnd how do I know all this? Just who do I think I am?\nWell, of course: I\u2019m an expert.\nTom Nichols is a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College and an adjunct at the Harvard Extension School.

    "scraped_body": "\u201cYou, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain\u2019t about how hard ya hit. It\u2019s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That\u2019s how winning is done!\u201d\u2014 Rocky BalboaI\u2019ve started a couple of startups in the past and I probably did everything wrong someone could. But I\u2019ve learned so much from my failures and also from a great community that supported me from day one. People that I haven\u2019t met before. Startups that I haven\u2019t heard of before. They all answered my questions patiently, connected me with the right people and did everything to help me succeed without wanting something in return.That\u2019s why we \u2014 that\u2019s Moritz and me \u2014 want to keep Samu as transparent and open as possible. Sharing what worked for us and what did not. Helping people like me to pursue their dreams.How I came up with the ideaFinding an idea for a startup is never easy, but I would give you the following advice: try solving a problem that you experience yourself and haven\u2019t found any solution for it yet.For me this problem always has been managing my tasks. I\u2019ve tried out so many different tools over the last 10 years, but none of them just felt right. I\u2019ve nearly always lost my focus \u2014 which meant ending up feeling less productive than without a task management tool.\u201cWhat is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.\u201d\u2014 Dwight D. EisenhowerWhen I was thinking on how to solve this problem for me, it struck me. I\u2019ve remembered something I\u2019ve learned back at school: the Eisenhower matrix, a time management technique used by presidents, business leaders and celebrities. I immediately loved the idea. It is simple, it\u2019s in a niche with little competition and it\u2019s widely used across people all over the world.Validating my assumptionsI\u2019ve spent around one and half years building another startup, and it ultimately failed. I did a lot of mistakes, but assuming to know what people wanted was probably the biggest one. We built an amazing piece of technology, but people just had no need for it.At the end of that period I was introduced to the Lean Startup approach by Eric Ries. I was fascinated, especially after I found out that Buffer \u2014 a startup that I was closely following for 3 years \u2014 used the same approach to build their company. Joel, the founder of Buffer, actually invented a very smart approach to validate if people were willing to pay for a service that does not even exist.\u201cSamu is a way to bring mindfulness into everyday life as well as to get things done.\u201d \u2014 WikipediaInspired by Joel\u2019s approach I\u2019ve called the product Samu as I liked its meaning and used samuapp.com as the domain. I needed a homepage explaining the product and a pricing page explaining the subscription plans. If a user tried to sign up, I\u2019ve displayed a dialog asking for his email address.The complete website was up and running in less than 5 hours.Finally the time came to test my assumption. I posted Samu in a few Facebook groups and tweeted a couple of times about it. This brought me close to 500 visitors, leading to 93 people trying to sign up. More interesting, 10 people opted to give me their email address although they\u2019ve been told that this service does not exist yet.This was the validation of my assumption. People are interested in paying for such a service. On a personal level this experiment was a huge success too. Instead of spending time on developing something that people might want, I can now build a product with the people that are willing to pay for this service.Finding a co-founderI quickly realized that my coding skills are not enough to build this product. I\u2019ve built a basic prototype, but it wasn\u2019t something that you could sell. And I know that a lot of people say that you should be ashamed of your first version, but I don\u2019t think this is entirely true in 2016. People are used to beautiful designs these days and there\u2019s way more competition than 10 or even 5 years ago.So I needed a technical co-founder. Someone who has a lot of experience in building products and ideally also experience on a business level. But how do you find such a guy?Two pizzas is just right for two people :-)I think in the end it\u2019s often luck. Being at the right place at the right time. But it definitely helps to have a large network.I\u2019ve met Moritz while I was still working for Die Socialisten. He was the best friend of my former CTO and helped us as a freelancer with one of our projects last summer. From the beginning I was not only amazed by his skills, but also by his desire to ship great products.I told him about my idea and how I validated it. I showed him the designs and the prototype I\u2019ve built. Although he liked it from the beginning, it was his girlfriend who finally convinced him by telling him that she uses the Eisenhower Matrix at work (without any tool).Building a MVP & first paying customerOne of the core principles of the Lean Startup method is to work smarter, not harder. So instead of spending months on building a product packed with features, we opted to build a minimum viable product that can be released in less than 30 days.Additionally validating our assumption had a great positive side effect: we were able to get customer feedback while still developing the MVP. This was extremely valuable and it made sure that we built a product for the needs of our users. Furthermore it helped us to release an extremely stable product as our users were amazingly fast in finding bugs.After exactly 24 days we\u2019ve released Samu to the public. It felt amazing. Even better, we were able to welcome our first paying customer only two days afterwards.",

    "scraped_body": "\n\t\t\nNowadays, thanks to faster Internet and improved online communications, more and more businesses are hiring remote workers. Many professionals are providing their services through remote jobs, which allow them to enjoy numerous benefits. Some of these include: a more balanced work and personal life, financial benefits (saving money on gas or fare), becoming more productive, avoiding traffic, and dealing with fewer office distractions.\nOffering remote work also benefits employers. When quality remote workers are managed properly, those who employ them can also expect to reap huge benefits. Some of the greatest benefits that remote work can bring to employers include: improved workforce productivity, reduced carbon footprint, and becoming more eco-friendly.\nIf you are planning to outsource jobs to remote workers, you should understand that, while you will easily find a lot of these kinds of individuals, it does not mean that they will all make great employees simply because their rate of pay is often much less than onshore ones. The key is to know exactly what to do when it comes to searching for quality remote employees. So to help you get started and ensure that you will be hiring the right applicants at fair prices (not to mention those with access to high speed Internet), here are four tips to keep in mind.\nNarrow Down Your List to Potential Candidates Who Have the Right Traits\n\nKnowing what the right traits to look for are in a remote worker will go a long way to helping you ensure that those you will hire are indeed the best for your organization. There are certain traits that you want your remote employees to have, so looking for these will help you narrow down your list of prospects. You should consider incorporating personality testing in your recruitment process in general just to understand who you are as a company and what you are looking for in your staff. This type of test, in addition to helping you determine whether the applicant is an introvert or an extrovert, will also aid you in analyzing the applicant\u2019s traits, work ethics, and values.\nHere are 5 of the most important qualities you need to look for:\n\nTime Management \u2013 Since you will not be able to directly supervise your remote employees, you need them to be masters when it comes to managing their own time. They should be able to properly demonstrate their skills in managing themselves without your constant supervision so that they can always complete their tasks on time and without delays.\n\n\nThere are various ways for you to check a job applicant\u2019s time management skills and have them provide you with the proof that you need. One is to go through the traditional employment verification process, wherein you will contact the previous employer to find out about his/her work record there. Another way is to make the applicants understand that you are particularly looking for someone who possesses this skill set. You should also inform them that doing so would expedite the recruitment process and screen out those that are looking for in-office work.\n\n\nTakes Initiative \u2013 It is highly likely that many of your remote workers will be in different time zones. With this being said, it will help if they are able to take initiative on the tasks handed to them rather than waiting for you to wake up and answer their questions or give them instructions. They should also ask as many relevant questions as possible when necessary so as not to waste time (and your money) taking the project the wrong way.\n\n\nGoal Oriented \u2013 Your remote workers should be goal oriented. It means that they have delivered exemplary results in all of the tasks assigned to them. They are ambitious, a trait that can be seen not only in the results of the project they were given but also in the timely manner of their delivery. Aside from personality testing, you can also check this by going through their previous projects, understanding if goals were met. By ensuring that all the members of your remote staff understand the organization\u2019s goals and how the quality of their work will affect these, they will be able to work better and collaborate more efficiently.\n\n\nProof of Past Success \u2013 This is very important. You need to make sure that the people you will be hiring are trustworthy, especially since you will not be able to supervise them in a direct manner. Ask the potential candidates to provide you with samples of past work as well as references. Use these to find out the quality of work they provided and if they were able to meet deadlines without problems.\n\nTake Advantage of Online Marketplaces\n\nSince remote working is all about online communication, it only makes sense that you will find such professionals online. Conduct your search and start with quality online marketplaces.\nGreat examples of online marketplaces are oDesk, eLance, Freelancer, Guru, 99 Designs and Virtual Coworker. These sites also implement their own screening process, so taking advantage of them will help you save some time. A big plus for these marketplaces is that you are able to instantly read presumably unbiased reviews of freelancers past work. You should also make your requests as specific as possible so that you can further reduce the number of prospects you have to deal with.\nKnow the Right Questions to Ask\nOnce you have a shortened list of potential job candidates, you can now start conducting interviews. You can always do this following your organization\u2019s traditional methods, but since we are talking about remote working, there are a few other important questions you should never forget to ask. Here are some of the areas that you need to know more about:\n\n\nInternet Connection \u2013 Not all internet is the same. Some countries have a huge advantage with connection to the Net. You may want to take a closer look into these areas and consider hiring employees who live in them. For example, according to this Bloomberg report, Hong Kong is the region with the fastest Internet. Next on the list are Japan, Romania, South Korea, Latvia, Singapore, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\n\nTroubleshooting IT \u2013 Of course, even the fastest Internet connection can be problematic at times. This is why you also want to hire a remote employee who have some knowledge in troubleshooting such problems. You can find this out easily by asking prospects what they will do in the event that their Internet service stops working. If their answer is to just wait for someone else to fix it for them, then you know that they have limited knowledge in resolving Internet-related problems that they are likely to encounter. If not, then your company\u2019s IT department should be able to compensate here with remote troubleshooting.\n\n\nWork Environment \u2013 While high speed Internet connection is definitely a must, having a separate work area (preferable with a door) is just as important. This will allow them to work better and be more focused, ensuring that they deliver quality work without delays.\n\n\nNegotiate Payment and Convenient Work Schedules\nSince you are expecting your remote workers to deliver high quality results and meet deadlines, you should also be prepared to pay them right for their hard work. One way to ensure that the rate you will be offering is within the acceptable range is to factor in the cost of living index in the employee\u2019s country.\nFor example, if you are going to hire remote workers from countries and cities known for having the fastest Internet connection, take a look at each of the factors that comprise their cost of living index. Hong Kong, which had an average peak Internet speed of 63.6 megabits/second, has a consumer price index of 80.87. With rent, it is 97.95. More on this math later in the next Worksnaps Blog Post.\nSo what does this mean for you? It simply means that when it comes to negotiating payment with your prospective remote workers, you also have to take into consideration their cost of living. You have to come up with a rate that you and your potential employees will be comfortable with. If you go way below this index, your chances of finding good remote workers will go down. What you will be left with are those willing to work for less but who deliver results far below what your organization needs, whose Internet connection may be problematic, and whose work ethics are less-than-perfect.\nTo be continued\u2026\nThis is the first part of our two-part series on finding quality remote workers.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfaster Internethigh speed InternetInternet connection\n\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n\n\nHack in the box & stuff\nSkip to\nIntroduction if you are here for the techstuff. I submitted a CFP to \u201cHack In\nthe Box\u201d in Amsterdam end of may and the talk has been accepted. So I\u2019ll be\nspending part of my vacation this year presenting some of my research on cache\nside channel attacks from the last year or so. I\u2019m really excited because I\nthink I actually have some really nice stuff to present \u2013 not only is it\ntechnically interesting but I think it\u2019s far more relevant that the common\nperception in the infosec community. \u00a0If\nyou have a chance I think it\u2019ll be worth while going. Amongst those who is\ngoing to present is Jacob Torrey whose material I covered twice on my blog and\nwho in my opinion really is one of those who is pushing the boundaries of info sec.\nAlso Felix Wilhelm is going and I currently have his master thesis on my night table\nand thus far it is indeed very cool reading.\n\nPreparing a\ntalk obviously takes a lot of time and since I\u2019m an amateur this is going to\ncut down on the time I can spend on this blog. I have two more posts in the\npipeline (including part 2 of this post), but no idea when I can get them done really.\n\nFinally\nposting this blog post has been a big dilemma for me. I had the basic idea almost a\nyear ago and I\u2019ve been putting it off again and again because it\u2019s offensive\nand posting it is a moral borderline case for me. I decided to go ahead but\nwith a heavy heart. Also I have a heavy heart because when I started this blog\nI wanted to target the ambitious newbie. However there has been a tendency that\nmy work has become progressively less accessible and this particular post is\nprobably the least accessible thus far. \n\nIntroduction\n\nKASRL means\n\u201ckernel address space randomized layout\u201d. It is a feature of most modern\noperating systems meant to protect against privilege escalation attacks that utilize\ncode reuse attacks such as ROP (return oriented programming). The idea is that\nif an attacker doesn\u2019t know where the code is, he cannot setup a ROP chain to\nreuse the code. Therefore a modern operating system load driver on different\naddresses on each boot and this leaves an attacker in the dark about where the\ncode is located. Code reuse attacks has grown in importance for privilege\nescalations attacks with requirements for driver signing and wide spread use of\n\u201cno-execute\u201d settings on stack and other data in kernel mode, thus forcing the\nattacker to either bypass driver signing to load a driver, attack page tables\nor reuse existing code.\n\nThe\nattacker has typically relied on information leaks in known drivers that give\naway addresses that can be used to locate code. However last year I had an idea\nhow we might use the CPU design for our information leak and this will be the\ntopic of this blog post. That we can use CPU design against KARSL is\nparticularly bad news because CPU\u2019s are not subject to updates as software are\nand in the past intel has not been forthcoming with security fixes in this\nrespect. Also relying on CPU for an attack means that mean thing generalizes\nacross operating systems \u2013 this means many of the findings I\u2019ve made here for Windows\n7 will lend themselves to other platforms. On the other hand these kind of\nattacks may be applicable only on a subset of CPU\u2019s. I think that all modern\nIntel CPU with a 3rd level cache i3,i5,i7 and xeons from Sandy\nBridge and up is likely to be affected and possibly other CPU\u2019s as well.\n\nFinally I\u2019d\nlike to say these kind of attacks has been made before but I\u2019m not aware of any\nwith the same methodology as mine.\n\nFinding drivers\nThe idea\nevolved around the \u201cPrefetch\u201d instructions. These instructions are meant for software\nto give the prefetcher a hint to load a specific address into a certain cache\nlevel because the software will need it shortly. This can be used to\nsignificantly improve performance as the prefetcher runs independent of the CPU\nand thus memory is fetched before it\u2019ll be used. There is however a interesting\nthing with the prefetch instructions that caught my eye: They don\u2019t cause\nexceptions (except they are incompatible with a lock prefix)[2] Intel. However\nthey take a virtual address as input and will need a physical address for\nloading memory and placing it in the cache. Thus they may entirely by pass\nmemory protection mechanisms further that seem relatively plausible because\nsince they aren\u2019t actually reading data they should not in any way or fashion\nallow an attacker to read memory he isn\u2019t supposed to. Consequently intel might\nhave decided that there wasn\u2019t a security issue.\n\nMy first\nidea was to use the prefetch instruction in a modified prime+probe or a\nevict+time attack. That is make a guess about an address in a driver, then use\nprefetch instruction to load the cache entry and either evict+time or prime+probe\nto tell if you actual hit the address. This of cause is pretty slow and there\nis a lot of memory you\u2019d need to run this on before you\u2019d actually find your\nway around the kernel address space. I\u2019ll get back to this in another post.\n\nThe second\nidea is what if the prefetch instructions leak information through it\u2019s\nexecution time? I thought of 3 scenarios:\n\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prefetch does not leak information\n(e.g. the DS descriptor has a limit, prefetcher doesn\u2019t do anything on kernel memory\nwhen called from R0, is designed as\u00a0\nconstant time etc.)\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prefetch is slower on virtual addresses\nwhich actually maps to a page. One reason could be because telling the prefetcher\nto load the cache takes time\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prefetch is slower on addresses\nwhich is not does not map to a page because searching all page table entries\nfor an address is slower than just searching till you hit something.\n\nWell. First\nI dug into the descriptor issue mentioned in 1) because that\u2019d be a no go and\nsince I recall that 32bit XP actually has a limit on it\u2019s DS descriptor making\nit useless to access kernel mode memory. It seems though that this is not the\ncase in 64 bit mode as 5.3.1 of the [1] Intel clearly says that limits are not\nchecked at run time. (I think there are some exceptions for FS/GS) So time to load\nup a debugger and write some code. First I loaded live KD and dumped a map of\nthe drivers using the \u201clm n t\u201d command. Then I wrote some user mode code that\ntimes the prefetcht2 instruction. I picked the prefetcht2 instruction because I\nassumed loading the largest latency cache was most likely to be actually\ncarried out by the prefetcher and thus most likely to be successful. I then\nwrote up code to time prefetching an address 20 times and pick the lowest\ntiming found. My argumentation here is that there is noise in memory sub system\n(hence the multiple accesses to try and cancel it out) and the lowest value because\nsearching for the lower bound would tell me more than an average. Then I picked\ntwo addresses to time in this way. One a few thousand pages below the first\nloaded driver and one in the first loaded driver. Finally I repeated the\nexperiment a 1000 timers. And voila the prefetcht2 instruction is faster on a\nvirtual address that is actually mapped. I speculate that this is because\nsearching through PTE\u2019s is aborted early and thus faster. I think I know how to\nfigure out if this is true and I may get back to it in another blog post. So I\nmoved on and wrote up a small program that\u2019d scan a small portion of the kernel\nmemory address space and tell me if a page was mapped or not and compared it to\nmy module list. It worked beyond any expectation.\n\nSo how fast\ncan I scan? It takes about 112 CLK\u2019s for a miss and 85 CLK\u2019s for hit on my wife\u2019s\nsandy bridge computer. An approximate value (with 20 timings per address)\nincluding code over head is that I run around 500k probes per second. With a\n64bit address space that too is impractical to scan the entire address space\nwith. However first we should notice that modern operating systems are paging\nand thus we only need to probe once per page. A page is usually 4096 bytes\nlarge. Also on windows 7 it appears that the 16 upper bits are all set for\ndrivers further reducing the problem. Finally Windows 7 loads drivers continuously\n\u2013 on my computer around 100 mega bytes of them \u2013 and thus I only have to run\nthrough a 48 bit address space in 100 megabyte steps to find where the drivers\nare hidden. This reduces the problem to a practical 6 second problem. Now I do\nget a few false positives on this scan. Other stuff than drivers maybe located\nin this space and I may have some tuning problems and additional probing could\nfurther reduce these. But I consistently find the drivers and only a few false\npositives.\n\nWhat was a\nblessing above \u2013 that the drivers are clustered into one big chuck of pages \u2013\nis a curse going forward. The problem is that we do not get the size of the individual\ndrivers and thus is unable to tell which is which for a gadget search. However\nI believe we can solve this problem with modified versions of evict+time and\nprime+probe attacks. This however will have to wait for part 2 of this blog\npost.\n\nThanks\nI need to\nexpress my gratitude to Nishat Herath of Qualys for discussions on this topic I\nhad with him.\n\n\nLitterature\n[1] Intel: \u201cIntel\u00ae\n64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual.

    "scraped_body": "\nWhen I was a young coder, just starting out in the big scary world of enterprise software, an older, far more experienced chap gave me a stern warning about hard coding values in my software. \u201cThey will have to change at some point, and you don\u2019t want to recompile and redeploy your application just to change the VAT tax rate.\u201d I took this advice to heart and soon every value that my application needed was loaded from a huge .ini file. I still think it\u2019s good advice, but be warned, like most things in software, it\u2019s good advice up to a point. Beyond that point lies pain.   Let me introduce you to my \u2018Configuration Complexity Clock\u2019.    This clock tells a story. We start at midnight, 12 o\u2019clock, with a simple new requirement which we quickly code up as a little application. It\u2019s not expected to last very long, just a stop-gap in some larger strategic scheme, so we\u2019ve hard-coded all the application\u2019s values. Months pass, the application becomes widely used, but there\u2019s a problem, some of the business values change, so we find ourselves rebuilding and re-deploying it just to change a few numbers. This is obviously wrong. The solution is simple, we\u2019ll move those values out into a configuration file, maybe some appsettings in our App.config. Now we\u2019re at 2 on the clock.  Time passes and our application is now somewhat entrenched in our organisation. The business continues to evolve and as it does, more values are moved to our configuration file. Now appsettings are no longer sufficient, we have groups of values and hierarchies of values. If we\u2019re good, by now we will have moved our configuration into a dedicated XML schema that gets de-serialized into a configuration model. If we\u2019re not so good we might have shoe-horned repeated and multi-dimensional values into some strange tilda and pipe separated strings. Now we\u2019re at 4 or 5 on the clock.  More time passes, the irritating \u2018chief software architect\u2019 has been sacked and our little application is now core to our organisation. The business rules become more complex and so does our configuration. In fact there\u2019s now a considerable learning curve before a new hire can successfully carry out a deployment. One of our new hires is a very clever chap, he\u2019s seen this situation before. \u201cWhat we need is a business rules engine\u201d he declares. Now this looks promising. The configuration moves from its XML file into a database and has its own specialised GUI. Initially there was hope that non-technical business users would be able to use the GUI to configure the application, but that turned out to be a false hope; the mapping of business rules into the engine requires a level of expertise that only some members of the development team possess. We\u2019re now at 6 on the clock.  Frustratingly there are still some business requirements that can\u2019t be configured using the new rules engine. Some logical conditions simply aren\u2019t configurable using its GUI, and so the application has to be re-coded and re-deployed for some scenarios. Help is at hand, someone on the team reads Ayende\u2019s DSLs book. Yes, a DSL will allow us to write arbitrarily complex rules and solve all our problems. The team stops work for several months to implement the DSL. It\u2019s a considerable technical accomplishment when it\u2019s completed and everyone takes a well earned break. Surely this will mean the end of arbitrary hard-coded business logic? It\u2019s now 9am on the clock.  Amazingly it works. Several months go by without any changes being needed in the core application. The team spend most of their time writing code in the new DSL. After some embarrassing episodes, they now go through a complete release cycle before deploying any new DSL code. The DSL text files are version controlled and each release goes through regression testing before being deployed. Debugging the DSL code is difficult, there\u2019s little tooling support, they simply don\u2019t have the resources to build an IDE or a ReSharper for their new little language. As the DSL code gets more complex they also start to miss being able to write object-oriented software. Some of the team have started to work on a unit testing framework in their spare time.  In the pub after work someone quips, \u201cwe\u2019re back where we started four years ago, hard coding everything, except now in a much crappier language.\u201d   They\u2019ve gone around the clock and are back at 12.  Why tell this story? To be honest, I\u2019ve never seen an organisation go all the way around the clock, but I\u2019ve seen plenty that have got to 5, 6, or 7 and feel considerable pain. My point is this:   At a certain level of complexity, hard-coding a solution may be the least evil option.  You already have a general purpose programming language, before you go down the route of building a business rules engine or a DSL, or even if your configuration passes a certain level of complexity, consider that with a slicker build-test-deploy cycle, it might be far simpler just to hard code it.  As you go clockwise around the clock, the technical implementation becomes successively more complex. Building a good\u00a0 rules engine is hard, writing a DSL is harder still. Each extra hour you travel clockwise will lead to more complex software with more bugs and a harder learning curve for any new hires. The more complex the configuration, the more control and testing it will need before deployment. Soon enough you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s little difference in the length of time it takes between changing a line of code and changing a line of configuration. Rather than a commonly available skill, such as coding C#, you find that your organisation relies on a very rare skill: understanding your rules engine or DSL.  I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s never appropriate to implement complex configuration, a rules-engine or a DSL, Indeed I would jump at the chance of building a DSL given the right requirements, but I am saying that you should understand the implications and recognise where you are on the clock before you go down that route.  \n\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n\n\nWindows 10 was inspired by a vision that computing could be more personal and that your computing experience should be familiar, yet tailored, to the device you are using. With Windows 10, your experiences can move with you across any device, from traditional devices (like PCs, tablets, or phones), to next-gen computing devices that are new or newly imagined (HoloLens, IoT and beyond).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRgAKcNPDbA\nWe then invested in our Universal Windows Platform (UWP) to enable developers to build apps that move across devices, automatically adapting to the different device types and screen sizes. So regardless of whether you are using a 5\u201d phone, a 13\u201d notebook, or 24\u201d in All-in-One, the experience should have that familiar Windows look and feel, while enabling you to have a richer experience as the screen real estate grows.\nThis enables Windows 10 to help people be more productive across their devices, whenever and wherever they are. Software innovations like Continuum, Cortana, and Windows Hello are ways we make Windows more personal and more secure. This week at Mobile World Congress we are excited to showcase a range of devices that embrace these new innovations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOne new device we see as a breakthrough in mobile computing is the HP Elite x3 \u2013 powered by Windows 10 and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. The device, specifically created for business, truly embraces the idea of the mobility of experience to help people be more productive.\u00a0 HP calls the Elite X3, \u201cThe one device that\u2019s every device\u201d. With the power of Continuum it can be used as three separate devices \u2013 a phone, a tablet, or a PC \u2013 bringing a new class of innovation to enterprise customers looking for a powerful device for all of their apps and experiences.\n\u201cWe believe in a world where technology will work for you and adapt to your needs, context and environment,\u201d said Dion Weisler, president and chief executive officer, HP Inc. \u201cThe HP Elite X3 is a revolutionary mobile device designed for an ever-changing, connected world, adjusting to business and personal needs so industries and individuals can keep reinventing how they operate, ideate and create what matters most to them.\u201d\nWith the power of Continuum the HP Elite x3 can be used as three separate devices \u2013 a phone, a tablet, or a PC \u2013 bringing a new class of innovation to enterprise customers looking for a powerful device for all of their apps and experiences.\nContinuum isn\u2019t the only thing that makes the HP Elite x3 innovative. The HP Elite x3 utilizes the power of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) to extend application experiences across any of the three device states, helping people and businesses get the most out of their hardware. The HP Elite x3 can be docked and used like a desktop PC so that people can do familiar desktop PC tasks, like using a keyboard and mouse with Microsoft Office, browsing the internet with the Microsoft Edge browser, or running any special LOB application. It feels like a PC. However, because of the engineering work we\u2019ve done with HP, people can simply undock their HP Elite x3, and have the versatility of both a phone and PC in their pocket.\nUWP will also save IT manager\u2019s time and improves total cost of ownership. With UWP, IT managers only have to write one UWP app and then have it scale seamlessly across the PC, tablet and phone experience. No longer do IT managers have to create multiple versions of the same app, for different form factors or operating systems. This will save IT managers countless hours, in both developing and managing the applications, improving the total cost of ownership of the device.\nThe HP Elite X3 will come with Microsoft Office, and HP is partnering with Salesforce to jointly deliver Salesforce1 on every HP Elite x3 device.\nThe HP Elite x3 with Windows 10 features Bang & Olufsen speakers\nNot only is the HP Elite X3 a productive device \u2013 it is a beautiful device \u2013 with premium design qualities that help it stand out. The audio speaker is designed by Bang & Olufsen \u2013 which is not only aesthetically pleasing, but incorporates dual front-firing speakers and active noise cancellation, making Skype video chats on the go a breeze.\nIt also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 screen and a stunning indoor/outdoor, WQHD 2560 x 1440 edge to edge display with anti-reflective coating. It comes with a 16-megapixel camera on the back with a low light sensor and LED flash. For business executives who travel extensively, HP has built in dual SIM support, which can be used for two SIM cards or for an extra SD card for additional storage.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBW_2ajJxpo&feature=youtu.be\nThe HP Elite X3 also comes with a Pogo Pin Design on the back, to enable a variety of peripherals to plug in and integrate with the X3 \u2013 beyond what HP has initially created. HP has created two unique peripherals that will help businesses take advantage of all the Elite X3 has to offer. The HP Desk Dock includes a DisplayPort for external monitors, two USB-A and one USB-C, plus a wired Ethernet Port, creating a rich desktop experience on larger screens. And, HP has also designed the Mobile Extender, which uses wireless technologies to create an amazing laptop experience. The Mobile Extender has a near-zero bezel with a 12.5-inch diagonal HD display that weighs less than 1000\u00a0grams. It\u2019s an elegant piece of hardware that creates the laptop feel that so many love.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty88EHJuLpk&feature=youtu.be\nThe HP Elite X3 is also high on performance, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 core processor with 4GBs of RAM. There is a Cat 6 LTE modem and 2\u00d72 AC Wi-Fi. The phone also supports up to 2TBs of SD card extensibility.\nSecurity is paramount for our enterprise customers, and the HP Elite x3 comes built with the best in security in mind. Not only does the phone come with the enterprise-grade security that customers have come to expect from Windows 10, at the chipset layer HP has incorporated Secure Boot and other safeguards. The HP Elite x3 is also the first Windows 10 phone to use fingerprint biometrics with Windows Hello. The phone also comes with Bitlocker 128-bit encryption, VPN-SSL and Intune MDM and Reset protection.\nWhen the HP Elite x3 becomes available this summer I know that our business customers \u2013 and Windows fans \u2013 will love the unique and powerful experiences it enables. HP is well positioned to sell this phone into the enterprise and the HP Elite x3 rounds out their complete Windows 10 device portfolio across PC, tablets and phones. Congratulations to HP on creating a truly innovative, and powerful mobile computing device.\nThanks,\nRoanne\n\n",

Fewer Americans (38%) say Apple should not unlock the phone to ensure the security of its other users\u2019 information; 11% do not offer an opinion on the question.\n\nNews about a federal court ordering Apple to unlock the suspect\u2019s iPhone has registered widely with the public: 75% say they have heard either a lot (39%) or a little (36%) about the situation.\n\nThe latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 18-21 among 1,002 adults, finds that almost identical shares of Republicans (56%) and Democrats (55%) say that Apple should unlock the San Bernardino suspect\u2019s iPhone to aid the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation. By contrast, independents are divided: 45% say Apple should unlock the iPhone, while about as many (42%) say they should not unlock the phone to ensure the security of their other users\u2019 information.\n\nHowever, independents who lean toward the Republican and Democratic parties \u2013 unlike those who identify as partisans \u2013 hold very different views. By a 58%-32% margin, independents who lean Republican say that Apple should unlock the iPhone. By contrast, 55% of Democratic leaners say Apple should not unlock the iPhone, while 34% say that they should.\n\n\n\nAcross age groups, adults ages 18-29 are divided over what Apple should do: 47% say the company should unlock the iPhone, while about as many (43%) say it should not unlock the phone to ensure the privacy of its other users. Among adults age 30 and older, somewhat more say Apple should unlock rather than not unlock the San Bernardino suspect\u2019s iPhone. By a 54%-27% margin, those 65 and older think Apple should unlock the phone; 18% do not offer a view.\n\nThere are only modest differences in views across levels of educational attainment over whether Apple should unlock the iPhone.\n\nThose who have heard a lot about the dispute (39% of the public) hold similar views as those who have heard less about it. About half of both groups say Apple should unlock the iPhone to aid the ongoing FBI investigation, while somewhat fewer say they should not unlock the phone to ensure the security of other users\u2019 information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartphone owners are more likely than those who do not own a smartphone to say Apple should not unlock the San Bernardino iPhone. Half of those who own a smartphone (50%) say Apple should unlock the iPhone, compared with 41% who say they should not unlock the phone. Among those who do not own a smartphone, 52% say Apple should unlock the San Bernardino iPhone, compared with just 33% who say Apple should not do this.\n\nAmong those who personally own an iPhone, views are about evenly divided: 47% say Apple should comply with the FBI demand to unlock the phone, while 43% say they should not do this out of concern it could compromise the security of other users\u2019 information.\n\nAmong those who own a model of smartphone other than the iPhone, 53% say Apple should unlock the phone, compared with 38% who say they should not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

RSA Conference Cryptographers' Track (CT-RSA) 2016, LNCS 9610,\n          219-235, Springer, 2016\n        Latest version: [PDF]\n        \n        Archived on\u00a0[eprint]\n      \n      Summary\n      We show that the secret decryption keys can be extracted from PCs\n        running the the ECDH encryption algorithm, using the electromagnetic\n        emanations generated during the decryption process. By measuring the\n        target's electromagnetic emanations, the attack extracts the secret\n        decryption key within seconds, from a target located in an adjacent room\n        across a wall. \n      ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman) is a standard public-key\n        encryption algorithm used in OpenPGP,\n        as specified in RFC 6637\n        and NIST\n          SP800-56A. We attacked the ECDH implementation of GnuPG's\n        libgcrypt 1.6.3 (the latest version at the time the paper was written).\n        The attack asks for decryption of a single carefully-chosen ciphertext,\n        iterated a few dozen times, and then uses\u00a0 time-frequency signal\n        analysis techniques in order to extract from the electromagnetic leakage\n        emitted by the target laptop during execution of ECDH decryptions.\n      \n         Attacker's setup for capturing EM emanations.\n            Left to right: power supply, antenna on a stand, amplifiers,\n            software defined radio (white box), analysis computer.\n        \n        Target laptop performing ECDH decryption using\n            its secret key , on the other side of the wall.\n        \n      \n      \n      \n      Q&A\n      \n       Q1: How vulnerable are GnuPG and other applications that use\n        libgcrypt now?\n      We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under CVE-2015-7511\n      and worked with the developers to implement countermeasures. GnuPG's\n      Libgcrypt 1.6.5, containing these countermeasures and resistant to the\n      key-extraction attack described here, was released concurrently with the\n      public posting of these results.\n      \n      Specifically, Libgcrypt 1.6.5 completely changed their implementation of\n      the elliptic-point curve multiplication, to the \"double-and-always-add\"\n      algorithm. This is slower than the prior implementation, but more\n      resistant to side-channel attack since the sequence of high-level\n      arithmetic operations does not the depend on the secret key.\n      \n      Application-level status is as follows:\n        On Linux:\n        \n          \u00a0GnuPG 2.1.x typically\n            use the system's libgcrypt library installation, so updating\n            libgcrypt to 1.6.5 or newer is sufficient.\n          \u00a0GnuPG 1.x and 2.0.x\n            does not support elliptic-curve cryptography.\n        \n        On Windows:\n        \n          Gpg4Win does not support\n            elliptic-curve cryptography.\n          Cygwin\n            packages only the vulnerable libgcrypt 1.6.4, and does not package a\n            GnuPG version that supports elliptic-curve cryptography (as of\n            Feburary 16, 2016)\n        \n        On Mac:\n        \n          GnuPG for\n              OS X 2.1.11-002 includes libgcrypt 1.6.5.\n           Mac GPG in GPGTools does\n            not support elliptic-curve cryptography.\n        \n      \n      Q2: What does the measured signal look like?\n      \n      We measure the electromagnetic signal with suitable analog and digital\n      filter, and then apply FM demodulation. The resulting signal looks like\n      this:A segment of the electromagnetic signal obtained\n            during a single decryption (after FM demodulation and filtering).\n        \n      \n      In order to obtain a clearer trace and remove the interrupts, we aggregate\n      several dozen recorded decryption traces. The resulting aggregate trace\n      looks like this:A segment of the electromagnetic signal, after\n            aggregating multiple measurements.\n        \n      The information required for successful key extraction is the sequence\n      arithmetic operations done on the elliptic curve: doubling (marked as D\n      above) and additions (marked as 1 or\n      -1).\u00a0\n      These operations can be gleaned above, but we can detect them much more\n      reliably by analyzing the frequency components of the aggregated trace:Distinguishing between elliptic-point doubling\n            and additions. Top: a segment aggregated trace. Middle: the\n            spectrogram of the aggregated segment, where blue denotes\n            frequencies with low-energy and red denotes frequencies with high\n            energy. The bottom figure gives the final result of the processing,\n            clearly showing the locations of the addition operations.\n        \n      \n      From the identified elliptic-curve operations, the secret key can be\n      completely reconstructed.\n      Q3: You attacked ECDH. What about other cryptographic schemes?\n      Other cryptographic schemes, running on PC-class computers, are also\n      vulnerable to non-invasive\n        physical side-channel key-extraction attacks. In prior works we\n      attacked:\n        RSA implementations using sliding-window and fixed-window\n          exponentiation (shown at CHES'15),\n          as well as square-and-always-multiply exponentiation (at\n            CHES'14 and at CRYPTO'14)\n        ElGamal implementations using sliding-window and fixed-window\n          exponentiation (at CHES'15),\n          as well as square-and-always-multiply exponentiation (at\n            CHES'14).\n      \n      ECDH is faster than RSA and ElGamal, so it was harder to attack it using\n      low-bandwidth measurements.\n      \n      Ongoing works evaluates the security of additional cryptographic schemes. Q4: What if I can't get physically close enough to the target\n        computer?\n      For\u00a0RSA and ElGamal (though not yet for ECDH), similar attacks\n        have been demonstrated from large distances:\n      \n        Laptop-chassis potential, measured from the far end\n          of virtually any shielded cable connected to the laptop (such as\n          Ethernet, USB, HDMI and VGA cables) can be used for key-extraction, as\n          we demonstrated in a paper presented at\n            CHES'14.\n        Acoustic emanations (sound), measured via a microphone, can\n          also be used to extract keys from a range of several meters, as we\n          showed in a paper presented at CRYPTO'14.\n      \n      Q5: Is there a realistic way to perform a chosen-ciphertext attack on\n        GnuPG?\n      GnuPG is often invoked to decrypt externally-controlled inputs, fed\n        into it by numerous frontends, via emails, files, chat and web pages.\n        The list\nof\n          GnuPG frontends contains dozens of such applications, each of them\n        can be potentially used in order to make the target decrypt the chosen\n        ciphertexts required by our attack. As a concrete example, Enigmail\n        (a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically\n        decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An\n        attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims (using the\n        OpenPGP and PGP/MIME\n        protocols), wait until they reach the target computer, and observe the\n        target's EM emanations\u00a0during their decryption (as shown above),\n        thereby closing the attack loop. We have empirically verified that such\n        an injection method does not have any noticeable effect on the leakage\n        signal produced by GnuPG running on the target laptop. GnuPG's Outlook\n        plugin, GpgOL also did not seem to alter the target's leakage signal. \n      Q6: How realistic is the attack? What is its cost in practice?\n      The attack, in its current form, uses lab equipment that costs about\n        $3000 and, as shown in the photo, is somewhat unwieldy. \n      However, experience shows that once the physical phenomena are\n        understood in the lab, the attack setup can be miniaturized and\n        simplified. This is especially true for low-banwidth attacks,\n        such as ours, which measures frequencies that are three orders of\n        magnitudes lower than the clock rate of the target computer. For\n        example, in a we showed a compact for electromagnetic attacks on RSA and\n        ElGamal encryption, called PITA: ostensibly Portable\n            Instrument for Trace Acquisition, but aptly named after its\n        portable form factor which fits inside typical pita bread. The PITA is\n        improvised out of commodity parts and costs about $300. Other physical\n        side channel attacks, such as acoustic\n          attacks, can even be performed by a plain smartphone.\n        \n        Thus, it is likely that the new attack on ECDH can also be performed\n        clandestinely and at at even lower cost. Most adversaries would not go\n        through the trouble of using such techniques, given the sorry state of\n        security vulnerabilities at the software level (after all, a thief will\n        not bother climbing through a window if the front door is left\n        unlocked). Thus, our work is most pertinent to systems that are\n        carefully protected against software attacks, but \ufffd as we show \ufffd may be\n        wide open to inexpensive physical attacks.\n      \n      \n      Acknowledgments \n      We thank Werner\n          Koch, Yutaka Niibe,\n        developers of GnuPG, for the prompt response to our disclosure and the\n        productive collaboration in adding suitable countermeasures.\n        \n        This work was sponsored by the Check\n          Point Institute for Information Security; by the European\n          Union's Tenth Framework Programme (FP10/2010-2016) under grant\n        agreement 259426 ERC-CaC; by a Google\n          Faculty Research Award; by the Israeli\n          Ministry of Science and Technology; by the Israeli\n          Centers of Research Excellence I-CORE Program (center 4/11); by\n        the Leona M. & Harry B.

    "scraped_body": "\nTor users crying over CloudFlare's CAPTCHAs will soon be able to put away their onions, rather than their .onions, the company has suggested.\nCloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince told The Register he would love to create a no-more-tears system allowing the anonymizing network's legitimate users to access CloudFlare-hosted websites without being hit by buggy Turing tests \u2013 while also protecting his customers' sites from abuse.\nTor, which allows individuals to use the internet anonymously without spaffing personally identifying information to servers, is highly prized by privacy activists. It unfortunately also provides miscreants with a valuable layer of protection from the authorities, with their use of Tor allegedly accounting for more than 90 per cent of the network's traffic.\n\n    \n\nWhile definitive figures on the degree to which the network is used abusively are unavailable, its supporters have complained that CloudFlare \u2013 which provides CDN and/or DNS services for over a million websites \u2013 has allowed those customers to implement CAPTCHAs which are purposefully designed to hamper Tor users' anonymous access to the web.\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\nCloudFlare has always denied this. An FAQ on its support site states that the company \u201cdoes not actively block visitors who use the Tor network.\u201d It adds, however, that \u201cdue to the behaviour of some individuals using the Tor network (spammers, distributors of malware, attackers, etc.), the IP addresses of Tor exit nodes generally earn a bad reputation.\u201d\nAs such, CloudFlare's basic protection level \u2013 which is set by customers \u2013 issues \u201cCAPTCHA-based challenges to visitors whose IP address has a high threat score.\u201d\n\n        \n\nPrince told The Register: \u201cYou have to acknowledge the complaints that Tor users have. It's made browsing the internet much more difficult for Tor users, and we hate that.\u201d\nThe CEO is not alone in hating it. A bug tracker ticket opened yesterday by one of the Tor project's most well-known evangelists, Jacob Appelbaum, alleged that companies such as CloudFlare \u201care effectively now Global Active Adversaries.\u201d\nCloudFlare, according to Appelbaum, \u201cactively make it nearly impossible to browse to certain websites, they collude with larger surveillance companies (like Google), their CAPTCHAs are awful, they block members of our community on social media rather than engaging with them and frankly, they run untrusted code in millions of browsers on the web for questionable security gains.\u201d\n\n        \n\nComments in the Tor Project's trac page, however, show that Appelbaum is not alone in his criticism. Vituperative members of the Tor community declared their dislike of CloudFlare in the thread, saying that it gathers metrics which \"count as a kind of surveillance that is seemingly linked with a PRISM provider,\" as Appelbaum described CloudFlare's use of Google's CAPTCHAs.\n\nPrince denied this to The Register, saying: \u201cIf you sat at CloudFlare and listened to how much we're supportive of communities like Tor internally, it's hard to make that same claim.\u201d\nThe CEO also disagreed with another of Appelbaum's allegations \u2013 that the company isn't interested in engaging in a dialogue with the Tor project \u2013 though he stressed his respect for Appelbaum himself, whom he regards as \u201ca very smart guy.\u201d\n\u201cOur customers are website owners,\u201d Prince added, \u201cand if you survey them ask what they think about Tor, they would rather just block it in most cases. The reason why is because an enormous amount of abuse comes via Tor.\u201d\nAccording to Prince, third-party figures have suggested than more than 90 per cent of Tor traffic \u2013 in voluminous terms \u2013 \u201cis, in some way, per se abusive, and I don't mean that in terms of visiting distasteful sites, that's not our business, but is traffic that is actively trying to hurt the websites it is visiting.\u201d\nCloudFlare's CTO responded to Appelbaum's \u201cGlobal Active Adversary\u201d claim, criticising it for being an \u201cinflammatory introduction\u201d before clarifying that CloudFlare is \"not adversarial to TOR as an entity, we are trying to deal with abuse that uses the TOR network.\u201d\nMalicious traffic arriving via a Tor exit node is indistinguishable from legitimate traffic, as those using the Tor Browser Bundle share the exact same user agent and IP range. The alternative to a CAPTCHA providing a small Turing test to visitors to distinguish humans from email-address-scraping bots.\nConcurring with Prince's comments about engaging with the Tor Project, the CTO asserted that the company has had \u201cmultiple contacts with people working on Tor through events like Real World Crypto and have been trying to come up with a solution that will protect web sites from malicious use of Tor while protecting the anonymity of Tor users (such as myself).\u201d\nPrince also told El Reg that his company offered \"six or seven\" of its 125 engineers to work with the Tor project. Among the active Tor users at the company are the CTO, and Ryan Lackey, known for previously founding the Sultanate of Kinakuta-like Sealand-based HavenCo and joining CloudFlare when his company, CryptoSeal, was acquired in 2014, as well as \u201cat least 20 others.\u201d\n\"About a month ago, I blacklisted every single IP address that was used in the CloudFlare office network, so our own team had to pass the CAPTCHAs too, so we had to feel the same pain, and it is a pain in the ass,\" added Prince.\nThere have been bugs in the CAPTCHA system too, Prince added, forcing Tor users to have to pass the CAPTCHA more than once per site. \"We just see a tonne of abuse coming from those IP addresses,\" said Prince, \"and our system says it's statistically probable that this is abusive.\"\nCloudFlare is working on making things easier, however. The CEO told us that, \"for first time, we're allowing our customers to apply their own rules to Tor exit nodes.\"\nThe company will soon allow customers to whitelist Tor exit nodes. \"What I worry about,\" said Prince, \"was that I could not think of a philosophically justifiable reason to allow the whitelisting Tor exit nodes and not the blacklising of Tor exit nodes. We are just allowing customers to whitelist them, but I think a majority of site owners would rather blacklist them.\"\n\nI was at a hosting conference recently and somebody stood up and said, \u201cI want to ask you something specifically about Tor\u201d and somebody from the EFF stood up and said it was my question too. And then the person asked \u201cWhen will you allow us to block Tor entirely?\u201d and the EFF guy was like \u201cWow, I never appreciated how much malicious stuff the average website owner sees coming off of the network.\u201d\n\nThe Tor Project does not explicitly accept that it facilitates additional abuse. Its Abuse FAQ repeatedly states variations on the theme of: \"So yes, criminals could in theory use Tor, but they already have better options, and it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things. At the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and so on.\"\nPrince agreed with the principle that Tor was a legitimate service and said that the company has \"tried to feel the pain of those users too. We're trying to be as empathetic as possible to those challenges. But our customers are saying something else.\"\n\"If there's a technical way to do it, we're interested,\" said Prince, regarding a means of enabling the legitimate use of Tor while protecting customers. He suggested moving \"the proof-of-work problem to their side\" might help.\n\u201cI'd love to be able to work with the Tor community to come up with one solution,\u201d added Prince.\nPotential solutions are being debated by the Tor community on the trac page. \u00ae\nDisclosure\nThe Register is a CloudFlare customer. Our security settings require CAPTCHAs be completed by those coming from \u201cpossibly malicious IP ranges\u201d for the reasons stated above. While we apologise for any inconvenience this causes, it remains a useful security mechanism.                                \n                    ",

    "scraped_body": "The holidays are finally here and we wanted to celebrate by providing you with The 12 DevOps Tricks of Christmas. Our engineers not only live the DevOps lifestyle daily, but also do regular DevOps consulting for global 2000 organizations. I asked each of them to provide me with a couple tips that will help any enterprise\u2019s DevOps culture work better. These are The 12 DevOps Tricks of Christmas.1. Think big \u2014 start smallYou can do Continuous Delivery, maybe not straight away but get some building blocks in place. Continuous Integration is a great start.2. Dev meet Ops, Ops meet DevIf you\u2019re an Ops or a Dev person \u2014 Go for a coffee/beer with a Dev or an Ops person.As a Developer do some Ops stuff if you have some spare time. Understand the problem domain of the Operations team. Set up servers, install an OS, configure firewalls, clear down directories, install software. Automate this, clone this configuration and build it again (without using Docker :) )As an Operations Specialist, try your hand at development. Build an application, start simple. Add a login screen, interact with a database, maintain the data structure and data life cycle. Loads of examples out there, todo lists, gym session tracker etc. Host it somewhere.If you have a siloed structure, invite Ops to your daily standups, invite Developers from another project to a project meeting.3. Think testing right from the start. How can I test this feature?Tester: Insert yourself into the project development phase, Developer, grab testers or become one!Write your tests up front \u2014 just get into this habit. Tests that are run frequently are great automation candidates. Hold fire on your UI until it is stable \u2014 you can burn loads of hours writing tests for a fluid UI and these tests are a bitch to maintain.Execute execute execute. It gets easier.4. CI \u2260 CD.Get your applications built and deployed with better quality (CI). Orchestrate all of your deployments/releases across your release pipeline (from DEV to PROD) with full visibility into dependencies, bottlenecks and schedules. (CD)5. No one cares if a Developer builds and deploys a code change several times in DEV.Everyone cares when the code change has to be redeployed more than once in Production.6. You wrote the SQL to make a database change?You can also write the SQL to roll that change out. No excuses.7. Fast feedback is keyYou don\u2019t want to wait for weeks, months, years, \u2026 before that new fancy feature hits the production system. So the sooner you can put that feature out there, and get feedback, the better. This helps you to define if that is really the cool feature everyone was waiting for or not.8. Focus on your businessIf your business is developing mobile applications, you should be focusing on that most of the time. Having side projects that handle take care of developing your own CI or deployment framework are not helping your business. So whatever is not part of your core business, go shopping for it.9. Embrace failures, mistakes and faultsEvery failure, mistake, fault, \u2026 should be seen as a moment for inspection and adaption. This also means that acknowledging failures also helps in improving the overall DevOps organization.10. Select a goalkeeper to keep Ops from getting side trackedEveryone gets busy, that\u2019s the nature of the beast. Having someone in place to keep Ops on track to make sure small tasks get done as soon as possible and to keep ops focused on long term goals is a valuable habit to form.11. Remember your resourcesWe all get consumed by the projects we are working on, and sometimes we forget other people have already worked on similar projects in the past. Whether it is a great Github repository or a useful technical article you found months ago, just remembering there are resources out there to help can save you a lot of time and stress.12. Goals \u2014 Good to have, but let\u2019s be realisticSetting realistic goals is as important to team morale as it is to the bottom line. There is no lack of metrics to measure in any business, but setting SPECIFIC goals that are both achievable and that keep the end user in mind should be a goal in and of itself.Click here to view the original post.",

    "scraped_body": "\n\nFor-profit coding bootcamps, intensive courses that promise to teach attendees practical programming skills in a short amount of time, have rapidly become a phenomenon over the last few years. So many new programs are popping up across the US, and so fast, that some commentators have described the nascent industry as being in a \u201cWild West\u201d stage as regulators struggle to catch up.\n\n\n\nSome of these programs are reputable and selective in who they enroll\u2014Obama has even called them a ticket to a well-paying job for the underprivileged, and the government even offers some financial aid for those who enroll in them. But other programs, critics have said, might just be extensions of the kinds of predatory for-profit schools that came before them; the kinds of schools with TV commercials that scream, \u201cGet off your couch and pick up that phone today! What are you waiting for?\u201d The names are familiar: Corinthian, ITT Tech\u2014and Brensten.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tVideos by VICE\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nWell, you might not have heard of Brensten Education, but the company operated in Waukesha, Wisconsin for years before suddenly shutting down in January of 2016, leaving many of its students in debt and without a diploma. Near the time of the shutdown, Brensten was facing accusations from the Education Approval Board that the school was \u201cpocketing financial aid money and drumming up bogus reasons to drop students,\u201d decreasing levels of education and support staff for students, and not delivering the program as promised. A Brensten education, according to StartClass, cost $13,130. In December of 2015, just before the closing, police looked into a report that \u201cseveral students\u201d had threatened to return to the school \u201cwith violent intent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just there to churn out degrees and cash in quick, I\u2019m sorry to say\u201d\n\n It appears that Brensten has been reborn, however, this time as a coding bootcamp called devCodeCamp, started by the same people behind Brensten in August of 2015. Some former Brensten staff believe that students enrolling in the new Milwaukee-based coding bootcamp (the name itself is similar to reputable San Francisco-based hacker school dev Bootcamp), might be at risk of being similarly exploited. Tuition is $14,987 at devCodeCamp, and promises a \u201c14-week, full-time path to becoming a software engineer.\u201d \n\nA Brensten PR representative told Fox6 that devCodeCamp and Brensten are \u201cseparate legal entities and have been run as such,\u201d but the ties between the two companies might be closer than implied: Former Brensten CEO Jim Brent is now working at devCodeCamp, along with two other former Brensten top administrators, a recent Fox6 investigation reported. \n\n\n\n\n\nA former adjunct instructor at Brensten named Richard, who asked not to be referred to by his last name due to concerns over negative affects on his current career, told Motherboard that a \u201chandful\u201d of administrative staff made the jump from Brensten to devCodeCamp. Another former Brensten employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told Motherboard via email that two instructors moved from Brensten to devCodeCamp, and that Brensten\u2019s financial aid and career placement people handled both schools.\n\nRichard also confirmed student accounts, relayed by the Education Approval Board, that the school\u2019s staff was on a steady decline in numbers during his time there in 2015 (this has been denied by Brensten). In fact, he told me that he laughed at Brensten\u2019s curriculum when he saw it, and that the school did not deliver the promised returns to what he said was its largely non-white and underprivileged student body. \n\n\u201cThere was a very large push to get everyone cranked out, and to get everyone passed; it was based on a for-profit model,\u201d Richard added. \u201cIt\u2019s just there to churn out degrees and cash in quick, I\u2019m sorry to say.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis attitude may also be the driving force behind the new devCodeCamp, he said. \u201cI would be concerned for [devCodeCamp students], because of what I saw occur there,\u201d Richard said of Brensten. \u201cThese are people who just wanted to stop being broke,\u201d he said.\n\nFox6 found that devCodeCamp staff were encouraging prospective students to take out private loans in order to enroll in the program\u2014not problematic on its own, but a potential red flag considering the company\u2019s history. At the time of writing, at least one post on Reddit\u2019s Milwaukee subreddit is warning potential students to stay away from devCodeCamp. \n\nWatch more from Motherboard: Goodbye Earth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReally shady stuff, save your money and take free online courses if you want to learn to code,\u201d the poster wrote. \u201cI actually interviewed some Brensten graduates and felt so bad for them. They were really nice people and were obviously trying to improve their lives but knew absolutely nothing about IT,\u201d another responded.\n\nCoding bootcamps, like regular colleges and universities, sink or swim based on their reputations, which often translates into the quality of their graduates\u2014this, in part, means being selective in who they enroll. Flatiron School, one reputable code camp, has a reported acceptance rate of about 6 percent.\n\nAnother former Brensten IT instructor, who is also a former student and asked to be referred to as \u201cMJ\u201d due to professional concerns, told Motherboard that the selection process for students at Brensten slipped dramatically from when he was a student there, in 2008, and when he was an instructor, in 2014. MJ also confirmed that he had heard of Brensten staff making the jump to devCodeCamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a student, I had to go through a personality assessment, cognitive skills tests, word association, a basic IQ test; I also met with a counselor to go through whether this is what I wanted to do,\u201d MJ said. \u201cWhen I was talking to students in my class, it was determined that there was no personality assessment, there was no cognitive assessment, and there was no interviews. I personally polled my class and basically Facebook and Google was the extent of their internet experience up to that point.\u201d\n\nThese practices may continue at devCodeCamp, MJ added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them,\u201d MJ said. Indeed, MJ implored students considering devCodeCamp\u2019s program to look elsewhere, for their sake, and so did Richard. Richard also noted that Brensten students may be able to file for student debt forgiveness if they didn\u2019t get their degree as a result of the school shutting down. \n\nAs of November 2015, devCodeCamp was looking to expand its operations into Madison, Wisconsin. Projections based on 2014 numbers suggested that the coding boot camp industry grew by 2.5 percent, graduated more than 16,000 people, and earned more than $17 million in tuition revenue across 67 coding camps in the US in 2015. \n\n\n\n\n\nDevCodeCamp did not respond to Motherboard\u2019s request for comment. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "scraped_body": "\n            \n            I mentioned recently, buried in a post about UI changes, that Twitter\u2019s latest earnings report included this bombshell:\n\nWe are going to fix the broken windows and confusing parts, like the .@name syntax and @reply rules, that we know inhibit usage and drive people\u00a0away\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting problem here.  UI is hard.  You can\u2019t just slap a button on the screen for every feature that could conceivably be used at any given time.  Some features are only of interest to so-called \u201cpower users\u201d, so they\u2019re left subtle, spread by word-of-mouth.  Some features you try to make invisible and heuristic.  Some features are added just to solve one influential user\u2019s problem.  Some features are, ah,\u00a0accidental.\nA sufficiently mature, popular, and interesting product thus tends to accumulate a small pile of hidden features, sometimes not documented or even officially acknowledged.  I\u2019d say this is actually a good thing!  Using something for a while should absolutely reward you with a new trick every so often \u2014 that below-the-surface knowledge makes you feel involved with the thing you\u2019re using and makes it feel deeper\u00a0overall.\nThe hard part is striking a balance.  On one end of the spectrum you have tools like Notepad, where the only easter egg is that pressing F5 inserts the current time.  On the other end you have tools like vim, which consist exclusively of easter\u00a0eggs.\nOne of Twitter\u2019s problems is that it\u2019s tilted a little too far towards the vim end of the scale.  It looks like a dead-simple service, but those humble 140 characters have been crammed full of features over the years, and the ways they interact aren\u2019t always obvious.  There are rules, and the rules generally make sense once you know them, but it\u2019s also really easy to overlook\u00a0them.\nHere, then, is a list of all the non-obvious things about Twitter that I know.  Consider it both a reference for people who aren\u2019t up to their eyeballs in Twitter, and an example of how these hidden features can pile up.  I\u2019m also throwing in a couple notes on etiquette, because I think that\u2019s strongly informed by the shape of the\u00a0platform.\n\n\nText\n\n\nTweets are limited to 140 Unicode characters, meaning that even astral plane characters (such as emoji) only count as\u00a0one.\n\n\nLeading and trailing whitespace is stripped from\u00a0tweets.\n\n\nTweets may contain newlines, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any limit to how\u00a0many.\n\n\nIn the middle of a tweet, strings of whitespace (e.g. multiple spaces) are preserved.  However, more than two consecutive newlines will be reduced to only\u00a0two.\n\n\nAnything remotely resembling a link will be mangled into some http://t.co/asdf link-shortened garbage.  In some cases, such as when talking about a domain name, this can make the tweet longer.  You can defeat this by sticking an invisible character, such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, around the final dot so it no longer looks like a domain\u00a0name.\nIn official clients, links are shown unmangled, but without the protocol and truncated to about 20 characters.  The link to this article, for example, shows as eev.ee/blog/2016/02/2\u2026.  However, at least on Web Twitter, copy-pasting preserves the link in full, including\u00a0protocol.\nNote that Twitter\u2019s knowledge of domains is not exhaustive \u2014 it will link \u201cgoogle.com\u201d but not\u00a0\u201ceev.ee\u201d.\n\n\nFor the sake of its SMS-based roots, Twitter supports performing several commands by typing them in a tweet.  In particular, if you start a tweet with the word d or m or dm, the second word will be treated as a username, and the rest of the tweet will be DM\u2019d to that user.  Tweeting \u201cdm me if you\u2026\u201d will instead DM if you... to user @me.\n\n\nAccounts managed by multiple people, such as support accounts or politicians\u2019 accounts, sometimes sign tweets with a ^ followed by the author\u2019s initials.  This has no special significance to\u00a0Twitter.\n\n\nYou cannot use astral plane characters (which includes most emoji) in your display name or bio; they will be silently stripped.  However, you can use anything from the Miscellaneous Symbols or Dingbats blocks, and many of these characters are rendered with color glyphs on Web Twitter.  Results may vary on phones and in other\u00a0clients.\n\n\nReplies and\u00a0mentions\nA tweet can \u201cmention\u201d other users, which just means including their @handle somewhere in the tweet.  This will notify every mentioned user of the\u00a0tweet.\nYou can reply to tweets, which threads them together.  A tweet can only have one parent (or no parent), but any number of replies.  Everything on Twitter is thus arranged into a number of trees, where the root of the tree is a new tweet not responding to anything, and replies branch out from\u00a0there.\n\n\nA tweet that begins with a mention \u2014 that is, the very first character is @ and it\u2019s immediately followed by an extant username \u2014 won\u2019t appear on your profile on Web Twitter.  It\u2019ll still appear on the \u201cwith replies\u201d page.  It\u2019ll also appear on your profile on Android Twitter, which doesn\u2019t separate replies from\u00a0not.\n\n\nA \u201cmention\u201d can only be an existing username.  If \u201cfoo\u201d is not the name of a user, then @foo is not a mention, and none of the rules for mentions\u00a0apply.\n\n\nA tweet that begins with a mention won\u2019t appear on the timelines of anyone who follows you, unless they also follow the first person you mention.  That is, if you tweet @foo @bar heya, it\u2019ll only appear on the timelines of people who follow both you and @foo.\n\n\nIf you put some other character before the first @, the previous rule no longer applies, and your tweet will appear to all your followers.  So .@foo @bar heya will be visible to everyone (and show on your Web profile).  This is called \u201cdot-replying\u201d.  The dot isn\u2019t actually special; it\u2019s just an easy-to-type and unobtrusive character.  I like to use \u2192 or \\.  Some people prefer to put the mentions at the end instead, producing heya @foo @bar.\nDot-replying in the middle of a tweet is not strictly necessary, but sometimes it\u2019s useful for disambiguation.  If you\u2019re replying to @foo, and want to say something about @bar, it would come out as @foo @bar is pretty great, which is a little difficult to read.  Adding a dot to make @foo .@bar doesn\u2019t do anything as far as Twitter is concerned, but can make it clear that @bar is the subject of a sentence rather than a person being talked\u00a0to.\n\n\nOne last visibility wrinkle: if a tweet appears in your timeline because it begins with a mention of someone you follow, the tweet it replies to will also appear, even if it wouldn\u2019t have on its\u00a0own.\nConsider three users: A, B, and C.  You follow B and C, but not A.  User A makes a tweet, and B replies to it (@A cool!).  Neither tweet will appear on your timeline \u2014 A\u2019s won\u2019t because you don\u2019t follow A, and B\u2019s won\u2019t because it begins with a mention of someone you don\u2019t follow.  Then C replies to B\u2019s tweet, which puts the mention of B first (see below).  Both B\u2019s and C\u2019s tweets will now appear on your timeline \u2014 C\u2019s appears because it begins with a mention of someone you do follow, and B\u2019s appears for context.\nIn other words, even if a tweet doesn\u2019t appear on your timeline initially, it may show up later due to the actions of a third\u00a0party.\n\n\nA reply must, somewhere, mention the author of the tweet it\u2019s replying to.  If you reply to a tweet and delete the author\u2019s @handle, it\u2019ll become a new top-level tweet rather than a reply.  You can see this in some clients, like Android Twitter: there\u2019s \u201creplying to (display name)\u201d text indicating it\u2019s a reply, and that text disappears if you delete the @handle.\n\n\nThere is one exception to the previous rule: if you\u2019re replying to yourself, you don\u2019t have to include your own @handle, even though clients include it by default.  (If you\u2019re replying to a tweet of your own that already begins with some mentions, those will be prepopulated, rather than your own @handle.)  So if you want to say something that spans multiple tweets, you can just keep replying to yourself and deleting the @handle.  (This is sometimes called a\u00a0\u201ctweetstorm\u201d.)\nIt\u2019s a really good idea to do this whenever you\u2019re making multiple tweets about something.  Otherwise, someone who stumbles upon one of the tweets later will have no idea what the context was, and won\u2019t be able to find it without scrolling back however long on your\u00a0profile.\nIf you reply to yourself but leave your @handle at the beginning, the first tweet will appear on your profile, but the others won\u2019t, because they start with a mention.  On the other hand, letting the entire tweetstorm appear on your profile can be slightly confusing \u2014 the individual tweets will appear in reverse order, because tweets don\u2019t appear threaded on profiles.  On Web Twitter, at least, the followups will have a \u201cview conversation\u201d link that hints that they\u2019re\u00a0replies.\nEither way, the replies will still appear on your followers\u2019 timelines.  Even if the replies begin with your @handle, they still begin with a mention of someone your followers all follow:\u00a0you!\nI\u2019m told that many third-party clients don\u2019t support replying to yourself without your handle included, and the API documentation doesn\u2019t mention that it\u2019s a feature.  But I\u2019m also told that only first-party clients require you to mention someone in a reply in order to thread, and that third-party clients will merrily thread anything to anything.  (I remember when Web Twitter allowed that, so I totally believe the API still does.)  If you don\u2019t use the official clients, I guess give it a whirl and see what\u00a0happens.\n\n\nThe previous rule also applies when making longer replies to someone else.  Reply to them once, then reply to yourself with the next tweet (and remove your own @handle).  You\u2019ll end up with three tweets all threaded\u00a0together.\nThis is even more important, because Twitter shows the replies to a single tweet in a somewhat arbitrary order, bubbling \u201cimportant\u201d ones to the top.  If you write a very long response and break it across three tweets, all replying to the same original tweet, they\u2019ll probably show as an incoherent jumble to anyone reading the thread.  If you make each tweet a reply to the previous one, they\u2019re guaranteed to stay in\u00a0order.\n\n\nReplying to a tweet will also prefill the @handle of anyone mentioned in the tweet.  Replying to a retweet will additionally prefill the @handle of the person who retweeted it.  The original author\u2019s @handle always appears first.  In some cases, it\u2019s polite to remove some of these; you only need the original author\u2019s @handle to make a reply.  (It\u2019s not uncommon to accumulate multiple mentions, then end up in an extended conversation with only one other person, while constantly notifying several third parties.  Or you may want to remove the @handle of a locked account that retweeted a public account, to protect their\u00a0privacy.)\n\n\nPrefilling @handles is done client-side, so some clients have slightly different behavior.  In particular, I\u2019ve seen a few people who reply to their own reply to someone else (in order to thread a longer thought), and end up with their own @handle at the beginning of the second reply!  You probably don\u2019t want that, because now the second reply begins with a mention of someone all of your followers follow \u2014 yourself! \u2014 and so both tweets will appear on your followers\u2019\u00a0timelines.\n\n\nIn official clients (Web and Android, at least), long threads of tweets are collapsed on your timeline.  Only the first tweet and the last two tweets are visible.  If you have a lot to say about something, it\u2019s a good idea to put the important bits in one of those three tweets where your followers will actually see them.  This is another reason it\u2019s polite to thread your tweets together \u2014 it saves people from having their timelines flooded by your\u00a0tweetstorm.\nSometimes, it\u2019s possible to see multiple \u201cbranches\u201d of the same conversation on your timeline.  For example, if A makes a few tweets, and B and C both reply, and you follow all three of them, then you\u2019ll see B\u2019s replies and C\u2019s replies separately.  Clients don\u2019t handle this particularly well and it can become a bit of a clusterfuck, with the same root tweet appearing multiple\u00a0times.\n\n\nBecause official clients treat a thread as a single unit, you can effectively \u201cbump\u201d your own tweet by replying to it.  Your reply is new, so it\u2019ll appear on your followers\u2019 timelines; but the client will also include the first tweet in the thread as context, regardless of its\u00a0age.\n\n\nWhen viewing a single tweet, official clients may not show the replies in chronological order.  Usually the \u201cbest\u201d replies are bumped to the top.  \u201cBest\u201d is entirely determined by Twitter, but it seems to work fairly\u00a0well.\nIf you reply to yourself, your own replies will generally appear first, but this is not guaranteed.  If you want to link to someone else\u2019s long chain of tweets, it\u2019s safest to link to the last tweet in the thread, since there can only be one unambiguous trail of parent tweets leading back to the beginning.  This also saves readers from digging through terrible replies by third\u00a0parties.\n\n\nIf reply to a tweet with @foo heya, and @foo later renames their account to @quux, the tweet will retain its threading even though it no longer mentions the author of the parent tweet.  However, your reply will now appear on your profile, because it doesn\u2019t begin with the handle of an existing user.  Note that this means it\u2019s fairly easy for a non-follower to figure out what you renamed your account to, by searching for replies to your old\u00a0name.\n\n\nThreads are preserved even if some of the tweets are hidden (either because you\u2019ve blocked some participants, or because they have their accounts set to private).  Those tweets won\u2019t appear for you, but any visible replies to them\u00a0will.\n\n\nIf a tweet in the middle of a thread is deleted (or the author\u2019s account is deleted), the thread will break at that point.  Replies to the deleted tweet won\u2019t be visible when looking at the parent, and the parent won\u2019t be visible when looking at the\u00a0replies.\n\n\nYou can quote tweets by including a link to them in your tweet, which will cause the quoted tweet to appear in a small box below yours.  This is what the retweet button does when you add a comment: it tweets what you typed as normal, but with the first tweet\u2019s URL added to the\u00a0end.\nThis does not create a reply and will not be part of the quoted tweet\u2019s thread.  If you want to do that, you can\u2019t use the retweet/quote button.  You have to reply to the tweet, manually include a link to it, and be sure to mention the\u00a0author.\n\n\nWhen you quote a tweet, the author is notified; however, unlike a retweet, they won\u2019t be notified when people like or retweet your quote (unless you also mention them).  If you don\u2019t want to notify the author, you can take a screenshot (though this doesn\u2019t let them delete the tweet) or use a URL shortener (though this doesn\u2019t let them obviously disable a quote by blocking\u00a0you).\n\n\nLiking or retweeting someone else\u2019s retweet will generally notify the retweeter.  Replying to a retweet will prefill the @handle of the retweeter as well as the original author.  However, if you click on the tweet on Web Twitter, the retweeter is \u201cforgotten\u201d and neither rule applies.  This isn\u2019t the case on Android Twitter,\u00a0though!\nYou can tell what will happen by looking at the top of the tweet: if there\u2019s small \u201cRetweeted by \u2026\u201d text, it\u2019s treated as a retweet, and the named retweeter will be notified or\u00a0included.\n\n\nDue to the nature of Twitter, it\u2019s common for a tweet to end up on many people\u2019s timelines simultaneously and attract many similar replies within a short span of time.  It\u2019s polite to check the existing replies to a popular tweet, or a tweet from a popular person, before giving your two\u00a0cents.\n\n\nIt\u2019s generally considered rude to barge into the middle of a conversation between two other people, especially if they seem to know each other much better than you know them, and especially if you\u2019re being antagonistic.  There are myriad cases where this may be more or less appropriate, and no hard and fast rules.  You\u2019re a passerby overhearing two people talking on the street; act\u00a0accordingly.\n\n\nSomeone unrecognized who replies to you \u2014 especially someone who doesn\u2019t follow you, or who is replying to the middle of a conversation, or who is notably arrogant or obnoxious \u2014 is often referred to as a\u00a0\u201crando\u201d.\n\n\nWhen you quote or publicly mention someone for the sake of criticizing them, be aware that you\u2019re exposing them to all of your followers, some of whom may be eager for an argument.  If you have a lot of followers, you might inadvertently invite a\u00a0dogpile.\n\n\n\nHashtags are a # character followed by some number of non-whitespace characters.  Anecdotally, they seem to be limited server-side to 100 characters, but I haven\u2019t found any documentation on\u00a0this.\n\n\nExactly which characters may appear in a hashtag is somewhat inconsistent, and has quietly changed at least\u00a0once.\n\n\nThe only real point to hashtags is that you can click on them in clients to jump directly to search results.  Note that searching for #foo will only find #foo, but searching for foo will find both foo and #foo.\n\n\nHashtags can appear in the \u201ctrending\u201d widget, but so can any other regular\u00a0text.\n\n\nThere is no reason to tag a bunch of random words in your tweets.  No one is searching Twitter for #funny.  Doing this makes you look like an out-of-touch marketer who\u2019s trying much too\u00a0hard.\n\n\nPeople do sometimes use hashtags as \u201casides\u201d or \u201cmoods\u201d, but in this case the tag isn\u2019t intended to be searched for, and the real point of using a hashtag is that the link color offsets it from the main\u00a0text.\n\n\nTwitter also supports \u201ccashtags\u201d, which are prefixed with a $ instead and are generally stock symbols.  I only even know this because it makes shell and Perl code look\u00a0goofy.\n\n\n\nA tweet may have one embedded\u00a0attachment.\n\n\nYou may explicitly include a set of up to four images or a video or a poll.  You cannot combine this within a single tweet.  Brands\u2122 have access to a handful of other embedded\u00a0gizmos.\n\n\nIf you include images or a video, you will lose 24 characters of writing space, because a direct link to the images/video will be silently added to the end of your tweet.  This is for the sake of text-only clients, e.g. people using Twitter over SMS, so they can see that there\u2019s an attachment and possibly view it in a\u00a0browser.\n\n\nImages will generally be made lossy.  An animated GIF will be re-encoded to an h.264 video, even in cases \u2014 such as small animated pixel art \u2014 where this destroys the image and produces a video bigger than the original file.  (In these cases, scaling the original GIF up to a larger size can somewhat curb the loss in\u00a0quality.)\nA static GIF, JPEG, or opaque PNG will be re-encoded as a fairly low-quality JPEG.  This makes Twitter fairly unsuitable for sharing digital art or screenshots.  It also leads to extremely noisy images of text as they get re-uploaded many times over and re-encoded each\u00a0time.\nA PNG with an alpha channel will be left intact, making it a common trick for non-photographic images.  The exact heuristic is unclear; I\u2019ve added an all-opaque alpha channel and also tried making a single pixel 99% opaque, to no avail.  I\u2019m told that having at least one fully transparent pixel is enough to avoid being put through the JPEG\u00a0wringer.\n\n\nAttached have three different sizes.  The view shown inline in a tweet is https://pbs.twimg.com/media/something.jpg.  The larger view shown when clicking or tapping an individual image is something.jpg:large.  A third view, not actually used anywhere to my knowledge, is something.jpg:orig.  Despite the name, this is not necessarily the original uploaded image, but it can be larger than the large size.\n\n\nIncluding a poll will not append a link, but curiously, you\u2019ll still lose 24 characters.  It\u2019s possible this is a client bug, but it happens in both Web and Android\u00a0Twitter.\n\n\nAlternative clients may not support new media types at first.  In particular, people who used TweetDeck were frequently confused right after polls were launched, because TweetDeck showed only the tweet text and no indication that a poll had ever been there.  Some third-party clients still don\u2019t support polls.  Consider mentioning when you\u2019re using a new attachment type.  Might I suggest prefixing your tweet with\u00a0\ud83d\udcca?\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t include an explicit attachment, Twitter will examine the links in your tweet, in reverse order.  If you link to a tweet, that tweet will be quoted in yours.  If you link to a website that supports Twitter \u201ccards\u201d (small brief descriptions of a site, possibly with images), that card will be attached.  There can only be one attachment, so as soon as Twitter finds something it can use, it stops\u00a0looking.\n\n\nYou can embed someone else\u2018s media in your own tweet by ending it with a link to the media URL \u2014 that is, the one that ends with /photo/1.  This is different from a quoted tweet, and won\u2019t notify the original\u00a0tweeter.\n\n\nQuoted tweets are always just tweets that include links to other tweets.  Even if the tweet is deleted, an embed box will still appear, though it\u2019ll be grayed out and say the tweet is\u00a0unavailable.\nIf the link is the last thing to appear in the tweet text, official clients will not show the link.  This can be extremely confusing if you try to link to two tweets \u2014 the first one will be left as a regular link, and the second one will be replaced by a quoted tweet, so at a glance it looks like you linked to a tweet and it was also embedded.  A workaround for this is just to add text after the final link, so it\u2019s not the last thing in the tweet and thus isn\u2019t\u00a0hidden.\n\n\nTwitter cards may be associated with a Twitter account.  On Android Twitter (not Web Twitter!), replying to a tweet with a card will also include the @handle for the associated account.  For example, replying to a tweet that links to a YouTube video will prefill @YouTube.  This is pretty goofy, since YouTube itself didn\u2019t make the video, and it causes replies to notify the person even though the original link\u00a0doesn\u2019t.\n\n\nUploaded media may be flagged as \u201csensitive\u201d, which generally means \u201cpornographic\u201d.  This will require viewers to click through a warning to see the media, unless they\u2019re logged in and have their account set to skip the warning.  Flagged media also won\u2019t appear in the sidebar on profile pages for people who have the warning\u00a0enabled.\n\n\nThe API supports marking individual tweets as containing sensitive media, but official clients do not \u2014 instead, there\u2019s an account setting that applies to everything you upload from that point forward.  Media may also be flagged by other users as sensitive.  Twitter also has some sort of auto-detection for sensitive media, which I only know about because it sometimes thinks photos of my hairless cats are\u00a0pornographic.\n\n\nIf your own tweets have \u201csensitive\u201d media attached, you will have to click through the warning, even if you have the warning disabled.  A Twitter employee tells me this is so you\u2019re aware when your own tweets are flagged, but the message still tells you to disable the warning in account settings, so this is mostly just\u00a0confusing.\nCuriously, if you see your own tweet via a retweet, the warning doesn\u2019t\u00a0appear.\n\n\nBlocking and\u00a0muting\n\n\nA blocked user cannot view your profile.  They can, of course, use a different account, or merely log out.  This is entirely client-side, too, so it\u2019s possible that some clients don\u2019t even support this\u00a0\u201cfeature\u201d.\n\n\nA blocked user cannot like or retweet your\u00a0tweets.\n\n\nA blocked user cannot follow you.  If you block someone who\u2019s already following you, they\u2019ll be forced to immediately unfollow.  Likewise, you cannot follow a blocked\u00a0user.\n\n\nA blocked user\u2019s tweets won\u2019t appear on your timeline, or in any thread.  As of fairly recently, their tweets won\u2019t appear in search results, either.  However, if you view the profile of someone who\u2019s retweeted a blocked user, you will still see that\u00a0retweet.\n\n\nA blocked user can see your tweets, if someone they follow retweets\u00a0you.\n\n\nA blocked user can mention or reply to you, though you won\u2019t be notified either by the tweet itself or by any retweets/likes.  However, if someone else replies to them, your @handle will be prefilled, and you\u2019ll be notified.  Also, other people viewing your tweets will still see their replies\u00a0threaded.\n\n\nA blocked user can link to your tweets \u2014 however, rather than an embedded quote, their tweet will have a gray \u201cthis tweet is unavailable\u201d box attached.  This effect is retroactive.  However (I think?), if a quoted tweet can\u2019t be shown, the link to the tweet is left visible, so people can still click it to view the tweet\u00a0manually.\n\n\nMuting has two different effects.  If you mute someone you\u2019re following, their tweets won\u2019t appear in your timeline, but you\u2019ll still get notifications from them.  This can be useful if you set your phone to only buzz on notifications from people you follow.  If you mute someone you\u2019re not following, nothing they do will send you notifications.  Either way, their tweets will still be visible in threads and search\u00a0results.\n\n\nRelatedly, if you follow someone who\u2019s a little eager with the retweeting, you can turn off just their retweets.  It\u2019s in the menu on their\u00a0profile.\n\n\nIt\u2019s trivial to tell whether someone\u2019s blocked you, since their profile will tell you.  However, it\u2019s impossible to know for sure if someone has muted you or is just manually ignoring you, since being muted doesn\u2019t actually prevent you from doing\u00a0anything.\n\n\nYou can block and mute someone at the same time, though this has no special effect.  If you unblock them, they\u2019ll just still be\u00a0muted.\n\n\nThe API strips out tweets from blocked and muted users server-side for streaming requests (such as your timeline), but leaves it up to the client for other requests (such as viewing a single tweet).  So it\u2019s possible that a client will neglect to apply the usual rule of \u201cyou never see a blocked user\u2019s tweets in threads\u201d.  In particular, I\u2019ve heard several reports that this is the case in the official iOS Twitter\u00a0(!).\n\n\nTweeting screenshots of \u201cyou have been blocked\u201d is getting pretty old and we can probably stop doing\u00a0it.\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nAlmost all of Twitter\u2019s advanced search options are exposed on the advanced search page.  All of them are shorthand for using a prefix in your search query; for example, \u201cfrom these accounts\u201d just becomes something like from:username.\n\n\nThe one that isn\u2019t listed there is filter:, which is only mentioned in the API documentation.  It can appear as filter:safe, filter:media, filter:images, or filter:links.  It\u2019s possible there are other undocumented\u00a0forms.\n\n\nSearch applies to unshortened links, so you can find links to a website just by searching for its URL.  However, because Twitter displays links without a protocol (http://), you have to leave it off when searching.  Be aware that people who mention your work without mentioning you might be saying unkind things about\u00a0it.\nThat said, I\u2019ve also run into cases where searching for a partial URL doesn\u2019t find tweets that I already know exist, and I\u2019m not sure\u00a0why.\n\n\nAs a side effect, you can search for quotes of a given user\u2019s tweets by searching for twitter.com/username/status, because all tweet URLs begin with that prefix.  This will also include any tweets from that user that have photos or video attached, because attaching media appends a photo URL, but you can fix that by adding -from:username.\n\n\nSearching for to:foo will only find tweets that begin with @foo; dot-replies and other mentions are not included.  Searching for @foo will find mentions as well as tweets from that person.  To find only someone\u2019s mentions, you can search for @foo -from:foo.  You can combine this with the above trick to find quotes as\u00a0well.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been told that from: only applies to the handle a user had when the tweet was made (i.e. doesn\u2019t take renames into account), but this doesn\u2019t match my own experience.  It\u2019s possible the behavior is different depending on whether the old handle has been reclaimed by someone\u00a0else.\n\n\nSome clients, such as TweetDeck, support showing live feeds of search results right alongside your timeline and notifications.  It\u2019s therefore possible for people to keep an eye on a live stream of everyone who\u2019s talking about them, even when their @handle isn\u2019t mentioned.  Bear this in mind when grumbling, especially about people whose attention you\u2019d prefer to\u00a0avoid.\n\n\nNamesearch \u2014 that is, look for mentions of you or your work that don\u2019t actually @-mention you \u2014 with caution.  Liking or replying amicably to tweets that compliment you is probably okay.  Starting arguments with people who dislike your work is rude and kind of creepy, and certainly not likely to improve anyone\u2019s impression of\u00a0you.\n\n\nLocked\u00a0accounts\n\n\nYou may set your account to private, which will hide your tweets from the general public.  Only people who follow you will be able to see your tweets.  Twitter calls this \u201cprotected\u201d, but since it shows a lock icon next to your handle, everyone calls it\u00a0\u201clocked\u201d.\n\n\nSpecifically: your banner, avatar, display name, and bio (including location, website, etc.) are still public.  The number of tweets, follows, followers, likes, and lists you have are also public.  Your actual tweets, media, follows, followers, lists, etc. are all\u00a0hidden.\n\n\niOS Twitter hides the bio and numbers, as well, which is sort of inconvenient if you were using it to explain who you are and who you\u2019re cool with having follow\u00a0you.\n\n\nWhen you lock your account, any existing followers will remain.  Anyone else will only be able to send a follow request, which you can then approve or deny.  You can force anyone to unfollow you at any time (whether locked or not) by blocking and then unblocking them.  Or just blocking\u00a0them.\n\n\nFollow requests are easy to miss; only a few places in the UI make a point of telling you when you have new\u00a0ones.\n\n\nApproving or denying a follow request doesn\u2019t directly notify the requester.  If you approve, obviously they\u2019ll start seeing your tweets in their timeline.  If you deny, the only difference is that if they look at your profile again, the follow button will no longer say\u00a0\u201cpending\u201d.\n\n\nIf you unlock your account, any pending follow requests are automatically\u00a0accepted.\n\n\nThe only way to see your pending follows (accounts you have tried to follow that haven\u2019t yet accepted) is via the API, or a client that makes use of the API.  The official clients don\u2019t show them\u00a0anywhere.\n\n\nNo one can retweet a locked account, not even\u00a0followers.\n\n\nQuoting doesn\u2019t work with locked account; the quoted tweet will only show the \u201cunavailable\u201d message, even if a locked account quotes itself.  Clicking the tweet link will still work, of course, as long as you follow the quoted\u00a0account.\n\n\nLocked accounts never create notifications for people who aren\u2019t following them.  A locked account can like, retweet, quote, follow, etc. as usual, and the various numbers will go up, but only their followers will be\u00a0notified.\n\n\nA locked account can reply to another account that doesn\u2019t follow them, but that account won\u2019t have any way to tell.  However, an unlocked third party that follows both accounts could then make another reply, which would prefill both @handles, and (if left unchanged) alert the other account to the locked account\u2019s\u00a0presence.\n\n\nSimilarly, if a locked account retweets a public account, anyone who tries to reply to the retweet will get the locked account\u2019s @handle prefilled.\n\n\nIf a locked account likes some of your tweets (or retweets you, or replies, etc.), and then you follow them, you won\u2019t see retroactive notifications for that activity.  Notifications from accounts you can\u2019t see are never created in the first place, not merely hidden from your view.  Of course, you\u2019re free to look through their tweets and likes manually once you follow\u00a0them.\n\n\nLocked accounts do not appear in the lists of who liked or retweeted a tweet (except, of course, when viewed by someone following them).  Web Twitter will hint at this by saying something akin to \u201cX users have asked not to be shown in this view.\u201d at the bottom of such a\u00a0list.\n\n\nWhile a locked account\u2019s own follows and followers are hidden, a locked account will still appear publicly in the following/follower lists of other unlocked accounts.  There is no blessed way to automatically cross-reference this, but be aware that the existence of a locked account is still public.  In particular, if you follow someone who keeps an eye on their follower count, they can just look at their own list of followers to find\u00a0you.\n\n\nAnyone can still mention a locked account, whether or not they follow it, and it\u2019ll receive\u00a0notifications.\n\n\nOpen DMs (\u201creceive direct messages from anyone\u201d) work as normal for locked accounts.  A locked account can send DMs to anyone with open DMs, and a locked account may turn on open DMs to receive DMs from\u00a0anyone.\n\n\nReplies to a locked account are not protected in any way.  If a locked account participates in a thread, its own tweets will be hidden from non-followers, but any public tweets will be left in.  Also, anyone can search for mentions of a locked account to find conversations it\u2019s participated in, and may be able to infer what the locked account was saying from\u00a0context.\n\n\nAPI, other clients,\u00a0etc.\nI\u2019ve mentioned issues with non-primary clients throughout, but a couple more things to be aware\u00a0of:\n\n\nWeb Twitter has some keyboard shortcuts, which you can view by pressing ?.\n\n\nWhen I say Web Twitter throughout this document, I mean desktop Web Twitter; there\u2019s also a mobile Web Twitter, which is much\u00a0simpler.\n\n\nThe official API doesn\u2019t support a number of Twitter features, including polls, ads, and DMs with multiple participants.  Clients that use the API (i.e. clients not made by Twitter) thus cannot support these\u00a0features.\n\n\nEven TweetDeck, which is maintained by Twitter, frequently lags behind in feature support.  TweetDeck had the original (client-side-only) implementation of muting, but even after Twitter added it as a real feature, TweetDeck was never changed to make use of it.  So TweetDeck\u2019s muting is separate from Twitter\u2019s\u00a0muting.\n\n\nTweets know what client they were sent from.  Official Twitter apps don\u2019t show this any more, but it\u2019s still available in the API, and some alternative clients show\u00a0it.\n\n\nBy default, Twitter allows people to find your account by searching for your email address or phone number.  You may wish to turn this\u00a0off.\n\n\nTwitter has a \u201ccollections\u201d feature, which lets you put any public tweets you like (even other people\u2019s) in a group for other people to look over.  However, no primary client lets you create one; you have to do it via the API, the second-party client TweetDeck, the somewhat convoluted Curator that seems more aimed at news media and business, or a third-party client.  Collections aren\u2019t listed anywhere public (you have to link to them directly) \u2014 the only place to see even a list of your own collections via primary means is the \u201cCollection\u201d tab when creating a new widget on the web.  Tweets in a collection are by default shown in the order you added them, newest first; the API allows reordering them, and Curator supports dragging to reorder, but TweetDeck doesn\u2019t support reordering at\u00a0all.\n\n\nLists are a thing.  I\u2019ve never really used them.  They don\u2019t support a lot of the features the regular timeline does; for example, threaded tweets aren\u2019t shown together, and lists don\u2019t provide access to locked accounts.  You can create a private list and add people to it to follow them without their knowledge,\u00a0though.\n\n\nYou can \u201cpromote\u201d a tweet, i.e. turn it into an ad, which is generally only of interest to advertisers.  However, promoted tweets have the curious property that they don\u2019t appear on your profile or in your likes or in search results for anyone.  It\u2019s possible to target a promoted tweet at a specific list of users (or no one!), which allows for a couple creative hacks that you\u2019ll have to imagine\u00a0yourself.\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the verified checkmark (given out arbitrarily), the power tools given to verified users (mysterious), the limits on duplicate tweets and follows and whatnot (pretty high), the analytics tools (pretty but pointless), the secret API-only notifications (Twitter tells you when your tweet is unfavorited!), the Web Twitter metadata that let me write a hack to hide mentions from non-followers\u2026  you get the\u00a0idea.\n\n\n        ",

    "scraped_body": "Illustration by Jaime Zollars.For two years, Nicole has worked full-time as live-in caretaker for her centenarian grandmother. Looking to make a little extra cash, she signed up last September with Studypool, \u201can online marketplace that connects students with questions with tutors who can answer them.\u201d An Uber for tutors, if you will.Nicole created a profile, submitted copies of her driver\u2019s license and unofficial college transcripts, and joined the ranks of independent contractors powering the on-demand economy. Within six hours, she was in business, browsing questions posted by a vast diaspora of students connected via a convenient sharing platform. She quickly came across a request from a college engineering student \u2014 represented by a Spongebob Squarepants avatar\u2014looking for help with his calculus homework. Nicole bid five bucks and got the gig.\u201cHe gave me the login for his online math class,\u201d Nicole says. \u201cAt first I was like, OK, I have to go see what the problems are, and this is the easiest way to go see them. So I asked, \u2018Where do you want to start?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, I just need you to do the assignment for me.\u2019\u201dThis Spongebob-looking fellow couldn\u2019t have known that he was making his request to an especially scrupulous and qualified tutor. With a double degree in math and physics, Nicole has tutored professionally since age 17. She politely refused and offered to help him through the assignment \u2014 like a tutor would. \u201cHe was very mad,\u201d Nicole says. \u201cI got my $5, but he gave me a very low rating because I did not complete his assignment for him. I told him that I felt like I held up my end of what I said I would do, but he was not having it.\u201dNNicole wasn\u2019t just unlucky. Studypool, one of a bevy of on-demand tutoring platforms entering the ed-tech landscape in the past couple years, is being used as a vibrant marketplace for cheating and plagiarism.Browsing through the bids posted on Studypool is revealing \u2014 it\u2019s not uncommon to see students expecting to have their assignments fully completed in exchange for money. Everything from high school math quizzes to college-level essays. Negative reviews for tutors indicate that the work they did for the student got a bad grade or was flagged as suspicious. \u201cFailed my paper because 56 percent was plagiarized,\u201d reads one. Well-reviewed tutors are those whose work passes undetected and gets the student a good grade.Positive and negative reviews for a tutor on Studypool.\u201cI would say that 30 percent of the requests are for \u2018help\u2019 versus completing assignments,\u201d says a Studypool tutor who prefers to remain anonymous, and adds that about 10 percent of his income comes from providing answers through the platform. \u201cIt is largely a place for students to cheat. I think it is a sad commentary on the U.S. education system that this practice is \u2018needed\u2019 and has a large following. That being said, there were times in my college career I would have killed to have someone do a tricky assignment for me.\u201dCCheating is nothing new, of course. And this is not about railing against one particular startup whose product is, wittingly or not, being misused. It is about asking whether and how the nature of Silicon Valley market innovations may be at odds with the goals or values of education. While teachers and school districts struggle to find cost-effective technologies that can reliably improve the quality of learning, the sharing economy is insinuating itself into the classroom with little accountability for the outcome.Screen capture from a Studypool user.Uber set an example that many are lining up to follow. Eager startups, often moved by waves of venture capital and a mandate to unleash new, technologically lubricated market models, are disrupting everything from haircuts to personal security to legal advice. Online and on-demand platforms have already transformed education: Khan Academy, Teachers Pay Teachers, and various versions of the Uber-for-tutors notion. Some argue private companies should open and run innovative schools of their own. With so much disruption \u2014 the jury is out on what the net impact of it all will be on learning.Education Meets Silicon Values\u201cWe believe in foregoing the legacy methods of tutoring. If a question is the barrier to learning, why not simply address that specific question directly?\u201d \u2014Studypool\u2019s blogFounded in 2014, Studypool\u2019s story is a familiar one: A string of fevered dorm-room hackathons forges a clever idea into a viable software product. In a few short months, the slick networked platform draws thousands of users, attracted to its undeniable convenience and the opportunity to turn spare time and other \u201cdormant assets\u201d\u2014a car, spare bedroom, or, in this case, academic skill \u2014 into cash. The barely 20-year-old founders take their company to the Bay Area in pursuit of hockey sticks, angels, and unicorns.Last year, Studypool was nurtured and funded through venture accelerator 500 Startups. Richard Werbe, co-founder and CEO of Studypool, became the youngest entrepreneur in the firm\u2019s history to fund a nascent company past $1 million, a good sign of investor faith. Though not operating at quite the stratospheric scale of other familiar on-demand platforms\u2014Airbnb, for example, hosts more than 60 million users \u2014 Studypool is reaching and serving a sizeable market. According to TechCrunch, as of March 2015 Studypool was used by some 40,000 students and had hosted about 150,000 questions. Just under a year later, Studypool claims well over a million questions answered.Like any properly disruptive enterprise, Studypool\u2019s idea is compelling: Build a frictionless platform for the exchange of knowledge, allowing market forces to drive information where it\u2019s needed faster and more reliably. People have answers, other people have questions \u2014 provide a place for them to link up. Werbe points out that the company\u2019s ambition extends beyond providing answers to high school and college students. That\u2019s just where the product first gained traction.\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to build out and prove the hypothesis that marketplaces make things more efficient, and that should apply to information as well,\u201d Werbe tells me over the phone. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking for help, it\u2019s going to help if I\u2019m willing to add a monetary incentive, which is one of the greatest incentives in the world.\u201dIt\u2019s pretty obvious why this model would be appealing to students who cheat. Stuck with assignments you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to do, just drop a couple bucks and, in minutes, get what you need from someone willing and able to complete it for you, on your terms and on your timeline.It also makes a lot of sense for anybody with smarts and time to spare. If they work fast, tutors have good financial incentive to make themselves available for coaching \u2014 or just providing answers \u2014 on a per-question basis.\u201cIt\u2019s not cheap to get private help, so for a student who needs that extra help and is struggling with homework and can afford it, getting your homework done online seems like a great idea,\u201d Nicole says. \u201cIf I were just to do that student\u2019s assignment for him, it would\u2019ve taken way less time than writing out notes for how to do the problem. I could\u2019ve done his homework in under 15 minutes. And $5 for 15 minutes? That\u2019s not bad, $20 an hour.\u201dIn theory, everyone wins. Competition to answer a question rewards timeliness, and wait times have been driven down to under three minutes.Studypool gets a 20 percent cut of each transaction. And nobody benefitting from the service \u2014 customer or consumer \u2014 has much reason to complain about its possible ill effects.Screenshot from Studypool.Rarely is the sharing model of enterprise, epitomized by the likes of Uber and Airbnb, sensitive to the costs incurred by its host system \u2014 those two companies are hardly compelled to preserve the integrity of the \u201clegacy\u201d cab companies and hoteliers they are undercutting. Likewise, success for this platform isn\u2019t determined by whether it actually helps people learn. After all, optimizing and reducing the latency in busing information from one place to another makes sense \u2014 a lot of sense \u2014 for servers and data, but where brains and ideas are concerned, learning isn\u2019t always efficient. And any approach that offers a backdoor \u2014 knowingly or not\u2014where intellectual honesty is concerned is bound to reap the patronage of the many people willing to buy an answer or grade rather than earn it.Sharing Economy, Shirking ResponsibilityThe list of variations for on-demand tutelage is long and diverse: Tutor.com, WyzAnt, StudyRoom, TutorPanda, Tutorpace. Tutree arranges in-person meetings between tutors and students. Chegg Tutors offers live help via video chat. Attempts at hot-wiring a new market by connecting students to tutors run the gamut, from absolute free-marketeering on one end to models that more or less mimic the one-on-one dynamic of private tutors or school district\u2013endorsed efforts on the other.Something all of these tutoring-related startups seem to share is their assertion of an honor code, acknowledgement that their tool might be put to, but is certainly not meant for, academic misuse. But something else they share is a disconnect from the structures of accountability that we usually expect will keep students academically honest.Buy an honor code. Screen capture from Studypool.Cheating on a chemistry test could get you reprimanded or expelled from high school or college, but that\u2019s basically up to the particular school or district. If you\u2019re caught taking someone else\u2019s SATs, you might face charges. But unlike the friend who sat next to you in the administrator\u2019s office to explain why you colluded on an exam, no online tutor or startup CEO will likely take any heat for helping you cheat.In the case of Studypool, accountability is limited also by the encryption of students\u2019 and tutors\u2019 identities and interactions. (Its user privacy page states, \u201cPrivate questions cannot be found by Search engines\u2026 or by applications/software looking for duplicate content and plagiarism.\u201d)Studypool did not provide any numbers related to cases of academic dishonesty on their platform. It\u2019s something the company apparently isn\u2019t too worried about. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t really see it as a very common problem,\u201d Werbe tells me.The true extent of its misuse is beside the point anyway. The question is what responsibility a company has to ensure its product or platform does not become a go-to for academic dishonesty. Many students certainly benefit from using Studypool as a legitimate learning aid. Academic dishonesty is probably not what this or any other educational startup sets out to build a business on, but neither do they seem able to prevent it from happening.Werbe says Studypool has worked with (unnamed) schools in crafting its honor code. But that honor code doesn\u2019t seem to have any teeth beyond the risk of a user\u2019s account being suspended. Judging from how many accounts have yet to be closed for cheating, this is not the solution. Students will face real consequences only if a teacher or administrator catches them taking advantage of an easy leg up. Same as always.In any event, should a platform be held responsible for users\u2019 miscreant behavior?\u201cVery relevant to a school setting, people in the past have just copied and pasted information from Wikipedia,\u201d says Werbe. \u201cUltimately, Wikipedia can\u2019t really stop that. But they can take steps; the schools can take steps. There have been tools created to monitor if students are doing that, but at the end of the day, I think accountability lies with the students and the school itself. It\u2019s not something we support, if they do use [Studypool] for mal intent, and we will take it down if it\u2019s reported.\u201dA Welcome DisruptionThe notion of powerful online sharing platforms becoming a tool for undermining academic integrity is naturally worrisome. It would be nice to be able to point to some solution \u2014 to a mechanism or agency that can step in to prevent an on-demand model from enabling academic dishonesty. In truth, however, cheating has been around for a long time and is unlikely to go away, regardless of technology. Self-reported cheating rates in the United States have been alarmingly high for decades, upwards of 75 percent among high school students in recent years.Technology has long played a dual role in both enabling and preventing academic malfeasance. As Werbe noted, Wikipedia is potent as a learning resource and a temptation for stressed-out students. Turnitin.com, a system feared by plagiarizers for its ability to catch lifted content, constantly updates its algorithms to keep up with students who find ways to trick it.One professor I spoke to noted a colleague who forgoes tests altogether because of rampant plagiarism from online sources, instead having conversations with each student at the end of a section to assess their comprehension.\u201cWhen you look at the means of cheating, I think the arms race is an apt analogy \u2014 it describes the fact that there is always going to be a back and forth,\u201d says Jim Lang, professor of English at Assumption College and author of Cheating Lessons: Learning from Academic Dishonesty. \u201cThe story most people hear \u2014 that cheating is getting worse because of technology \u2014 we just don\u2019t have any data to back that up.\u201dUltimately, it seems that what drives people to an on-demand platform, as user and service provider, is the same thing that drives a student to cheat: cost-benefit analysis. Lang points to grade-oriented educational environments themselves, where cheating is rooted in the fact that moving on, rather than moving on with new knowledge, is what\u2019s at stake for students. \u201cAnytime you have people competing against each other for external rewards, and it\u2019s high stakes, you\u2019re going to have cheating,\u201d Lang says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea for faculty to establish classrooms as communities of learners, rather than as just sort of information-transfer spaces.\u201dAA startup plying its platform into profitability makes no illusions about trying to solve the problems in the systems they\u2019re upending. Indeed, they can stand to benefit from those problems. Plenty of students already cheat, but if there\u2019s an app or online platform that allows bypassing coursework in a way that\u2019s cheap and fast and largely risk-free, what\u2019s to stop such a model from becoming the norm? That\u2019s a disturbing thought, and what\u2019s being disrupted is no mere market.\u201cA lot of people, especially in America, really rely on the idea of education as the potential equalizer that ensures a meritocracy, that people can prove themselves in school and get ahead and get good jobs,\u201d says Ross Perlin, author of Intern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy. \u201cEducation has played a massive, fantastic role in enabling people to rise socioeconomically, but it\u2019s not an inevitable thing, and it\u2019s something that is very much under threat now with the privatization of education and trends like this. So the idea that education is this great equalizer may no longer be true in the same way, and that\u2019s deeply worrying.\u201dCan a frictionless market actually lead to gains for learning itself? These startups will tell you yes, but that\u2019s easy to say. Airbnb would much prefer not to talk about its users\u2019 malfeasance, preferring to focus on how many renters and communities around the world it \u201cempowers.\u201d You might hear, as Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg asked when bestowing his company\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d internet access to rural India, \u201cWho could possibly be against this?\u201dEducation is clearly susceptible to new technologies and markets. With that comes the opportunity to encourage models that will result in gains for learning. We are all stakeholders in our education system. We should feel incentivized to explore how new technologies and market models could be made to elevate education, not game it. After all, the sharing economy has already entered the classroom, and we should demand it to behave.Bright is made possible by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

    "scraped_body": "\n\n    I don't know if there is a statute of limitations on confessing one's sins, but it has been six years since I did the deed and I'm now coming clean.Six years ago I submitted a paper for a panel, \"On the Absence of Absences\" that was to be part of an academic conference later that year-in August 2010. Then, and now, I had no idea what the phrase \"absence of absences\" meant. The description provided by the panel organizers, printed below, did not help. The summary, or abstract of the proposed paper-was pure gibberish, as you can see below. I tried, as best I could within the limits of my own vocabulary, to write something that had many big words but which made no sense whatsoever. I not only wanted to see if I could fool the panel organizers and get my paper accepted, I also wanted to pull the curtain on the absurd pretentions of some segments of academic life. To my astonishment, the two panel organizers-both American sociologists-accepted my proposal and invited me to join them at the annual international conference of the Society for Social Studies of Science to be held that year in Tokyo.I am not the first academic to engage in this kind of hoax. In 1996, in a well-known incident, NYU physicist Alan Sokal pulled the wool over the eyes of the editors of Social Text, a postmodern cultural studies journal. He submitted an article filled with gobbledygook to see if they would, in his words, \"publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if it (a) sounded good and (b) flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions.\" His article, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\" (published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue), shorn of its intentionally outrageous jargon, essentially made the claim that gravity was in the mind of the beholder. Sokal's intent was not simply to pull a fast-one on the editors, but to challenge the increasingly popular \"post-modern\" view that there are no real facts, just points-of-view. His paper made the bogus case that gravity, too, was a \"social construction.\" As soon as it was published, Sokal fessed up in another journal (Lingua Franca, May 1996), revealing that his article was a sham, describing it as \"a pastiche of Left-wing cant, fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense \u2026 structured around the silliest quotations [by postmodernist academics] he could find about mathematics and physics.\"Sokal's ruse was more ambitious than mine. He wrote an entire article. I simply wrote a 368-word abstract. He submitted his for publication. I just submitted mine to a conference. Although his paper was filled with absurd statements, it actually reached a conclusion-however bogus-that gravity was still an idea open to serious debate. In doing so, Sokal actually had a serious point to make about the silliness of much \"post-modern\" thinking that viewed science as a version of the humanities where all views should be given equal weight. My paper had no point at all. It was filled entirely with non-sequiturs. I didn't even bother to mention anything about \"the absence of absences,\" because I had no idea what it meant and would have thus revealed my ignorance of the panel's organizing theme. In writing my abstract for the \"Absence of Absences\" panel, I violated every rule of good writing to which I usually try to adhere. Here's how it happened.In early January 2010 an email arrived in my inbox from a colleague. He had forwarded to me an announcement of a panel, called \"On the Absence of Absences,\" that several American sociologists were organizing for an international conference in Japan sponsored by the Society for Social Studies of Science and the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies. The announcement said the following:This panel addresses absences-the gaps, silences, and remains within the construction of knowledge and ignorance-in order to contribute to an ongoing STS dialogue; one that has roots in Bloor's \"sociology of error\" to more recent work in agnotology (Proctor and Scheibinger) and in residues (Bowker and Star). From feminist and postcolonial theory, we have learned to be continually vigilant about the dynamics and non-dynamics in knowledge construction and application. This panel addresses these negations, unseen crevices, deletions, and leftovers from multiple perspectives. Its aims to identify and theorize some of those areas that demand our vigilance in order to broaden and provide systematic ways to understand how absences and gaps are a continual part of social interactions and our STS studies. Interested Presenters: Please send us a brief abstract and title of your talk with your name, email and affiliation. We would like contributions no later than 15 January to compile and submit the session.I admit I had no idea what any of this meant. But I took that as a challenge. So I wrote a few hundred words of complete nonsense and in January 2010 submitted it to the panel organizers under the title, \"Music, Religion, Politics, and Everyday Life: The Tensions of Utopianism and Pragmatism in Movements for Change.\" Here's what I sent them:From the scribes and rabbis who wrote the original Torah, to the troubadour-activists who sang \"Which Side Are You On?\" and \"Waste Deep in the Big Muddy,\" to the gangbangers and hip-hoppers who create contemporary street rap, the relationship between culture, politics, religion and everyday life has been poorly understood. As Bloor observes: \"In fact sociologists have been only too eager to limit their concern with science to its institutional framework and external factors relating to its rate of growth or direction this leaves untouched the nature of the knowledge thus created.\" There is an obvious tension between romanticism and reality, between humanity and barbarism, between self-reflection and communal expression, which pervades both the written word and the oral tradition. Can a society promote utopianism and dystopianism simultaneously, while allowing its governing officials, whether military conquerors or democratically elected, to perform the necessary day-to-day functions of street-cleaning, sanitation, animal rescue, industrial production, hunting-and-gathering, maintaining law and order, and (what Heideger called the \"organicity of intellectual work\") educating children and reproducing the next generation. We might call this a kind of scientism of contradiction, or the contradictions of scientific production, or the contradictory intellectual discipline of everyday life. In other words, can the rigors of so called \"pure\" intellectual work (including those of the priestly class and its modern counterparts), the artistry of craftwork (or the craft of artistry), and the degradations of subsistence agriculture, mining, factory work, and retail sales co-inhabit the same society without igniting the ticking time bomb of social implosion, as we've recently seen in riots in the French suburbs and in the ghettos and barrios of Los Angeles? How, in other words, does the globalization of both production and knowledge work (the so-called \"Walmartization\" of societies) challenge our ability to think clearly about what is true in contrast to what is delusion? Self-delusion and self-discipline inhibits the reflective self, the postmodern membrane, the ecclesiastical impulse forbidden by truth-seeking and sun worship, problematizing the inchoate structures of both reason and darkness, allowing knowledge, half-knowledge, and knowledgelessness to undermine and yet simultaneously overcome the self-loathing that overwhelms the Gnostic challenge facing Biblical scribes, folksingers, and hip-hop rappers alike. Sociologists ignore these topics at their peril.Note the two quotes that appear in my abstract. I'd never heard of David Bloor before, but his name showed up in the announcement about the panel, so I looked up one of his writings and lifted a sentence into my abstract, although the quote I selected has no relevance to anything else in the abstract. The quote from Heidegger (whose name I misspelled in the abstract) is a complete fabrication. I made it up. Name-dropping is always useful in academic circles.A few weeks after submitting this abstract I received an email from Professor Wenda Bauchspies of the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of the organizers of the panel, informing me that my paper had been accepted and inviting me to present it at the Tokyo conference in August of that year.Professor Bauchspies soon sent me another email listing the other papers that had been accepted for the panel. They had the following titles:\u00b7      \"Agnotology and Privatives: Parsing Kinds of Ignorances and Absences in Systems of Knowledge Production.\"\u00b7      \"Science, Ignorance, and Secrecy: Making Absences Productive\"\u00b7      \"Alter-Ontologies: Justice and the Living World\"\u00b7      \"The Motility of the Ethical in Bioscience: The Case of Care in Anti-ageingScience\"\u00b7      \"Mapping Environmental Knowledge Gaps in Post-Katrina New Orleans: A Study of the Social Production of Ignorance\"\u00b7      \"The Absence of Science and Technology Equals Development?\"Using the Internet, I researched the works of my fellow panelists. Each had an impressive track record of publications and academic appointments at respectable universities, including the University of Arizona, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Washington State University, the University of Exeter (England), and Cardiff University (Wales). (Indeed, I've learned that versions of each of the papers they presented in Tokyo have subsequently been published in scholarly journals).Once my abstract was accepted, I had to decide whether to turn it into a full-blown academic paper (typically about 15 to 25 pages) and travel to Tokyo to deliver it at the conference in person. I wasn't sure I had the fortitude to turn one page of gibberish into at least 15 pages of gibberish, which I would then have to summarize in 10 minutes in front of an international audience of academics. I was also reluctant to ask my own college to pay for me to travel to Tokyo to pull off this hoax.I felt somewhat guilty when I received another email from the panel organizer that said, \"I look forward to meeting you in Tokyo.\"    Ultimately, I couldn't bring myself to carry out the hoax to its logical conclusion. I decided that I would be absent from the panel on the \"absence of absences.\" I never registered for the conference, although my abstract appeared in the conference program. Given its provocative (although meaningless) title, it is even possible that some conference-goers showed up at the panel expecting to hear my presentation.I assume the panel was successful, although I never heard from the organizer or any of the other panelists inquiring why I didn't make it. I even allowed myself to ponder the possibility that all of them were absent. Although I never wrote a paper or gave a presentation, my abstract can still be found on a website devoted to preserving the papers and proceedings of various academic conferences.Although this episode may seem like a waste of time, I did, like Sokal, have a serious point to make in submitting the abstract. I wanted to pull back the curtain on academic pomposity.American higher education is under attack by pundits, plutocrats and public officials who believe that many professors don't work hard and that what they produce is of little value to society. Most of their attacks are off-base, but there is a grain of truth in their claims. Academics who believe in the mission of higher education-teaching, research, and public service-need to defend academic freedom, but some of our colleagues have to clean up their acts, because it is difficult to defend the indefensible.There are many academics who write books, articles, and technical papers for colleagues in their own areas of expertise, but who also know how to translate their work into prose accessible to the general public. They share a commitment to the idea that colleges and universities-subsidized directly and indirectly by taxpayers-have an obligation to serve society. That means climbing down from the ivory tower and sharing their knowledge with people who aren't academics. The tradition of liberal arts colleges and land-grant universities alike is the notion of \"enlightenment,\" which means educating, explaining, and illuminating ideas that might be practically useful or simply interesting for their own sake. Over the past decade, there's also been growing interest in getting both professors and students to participate in various forms of public service, including a big increase in student internships and engagement with the worlds outside the campus.While it is true that some academics write for non-academic general audiences in books, magazines, and newspaper articles, most scholars-and a growing number of them-are content to write books, journal articles, and conference papers that will be read by a very small group of fellow specialists.I am more than willing to admit that just because I don't understand something doesn't mean it isn't well reasoned or accurate. But the proportion of things published in academic journals has become less and less accessible to anyone who isn't a specialist in that field. We live in an era of increasing academic specialization. As academia becomes more and more fragmented and balkanized into more narrow niches, an increasing proportion of what academics produce is unnecessarily obscure and obtuse, and, not surprisingly, poorly written. Graduate students read this drivel written by their academic elders, and then seek to emulate it, perpetuating the rule of pompous prose.In the 39 years since I finished graduate school, specialization has become more and more narrow, so that even people in different subfields of the same discipline-say, Japanese history and colonial American history, or Renaissance literature and Southern poetry-aren't expected to understand, or at least judge the quality of, others' work. I realize that all academic disciplines have their own language, concepts, history, disputes, and intellectual paradigms that require a level of specialized knowledge to fully understand. I can read, but I can't understand, most articles published in physics, zoology, or mathematics journals. I am a professor with a Ph.D. in sociology who now teaches in a political science department and chairs a department of urban and environmental policy. In other words, I do not have strong disciplinary loyalties and think that the boundaries between many academic fields are pretty blurry. I believe that most social scientists-sociologists, historians, economists, anthropologists, geographers, and political scientists-should be able to read and understand most of what their fellow social scientists write, if only they would write in relatively clear prose. Although I'm not formally trained in English literature, or art history, or other humanities subjects, I can grasp the basic points, if not the nuances, of most articles published by scholars in these fields, if they are written to be understood rather than to impress and intimidate.In his 1959 book, The Sociological Imagination, the radical sociologist C. Wright Mills mocked fellow sociologist Talcott Parsons not only for his \"grand theory\" ideas that seemed to have no connection with social reality or serious social problems, but also for his incomprehensible and convoluted prose, such as the following sentence:A role then is a sector of the total orientation system of an individual actor which is organized about expectations in relation to a particular interaction context, that is integrated with a particular set of value-standards which govern interaction with one or more alters in the appropriate complementary roles.If Mills were alive today, he'd be saddened by the exponential growth of bad writing by academics, especially by those on the left. The problem of academic jargon is not confined to a single political or ideological wing, but it certainly dominates much of the writing by leftists in the social sciences and humanities. I consider myself a person of the left, and my research and writing-focusing on American politics, urban policy, social movements, and labor studies- generally explores issues of social justice and democracy. But I have little patience for much of what passes for left-wing academic writing in the social sciences and humanities, which emphasizes criticism (often called \"deconstructing\" or \"problematizing\" by academics) of conservative and liberal ideas and social institutions, but makes little or no attempt to figure out what to do to make things better. I also have little patience for the kind of embarrassingly obtuse writing style preferred by many postmodern and allegedly leftist academics that obscures more than it enlightens and is often a clever mask for being intellectually lightweight. Professor Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton University made a similar point in an article published in the October 2005 issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology entitled, \"Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly.\" The Atlantic in March 2006 summarized Oppenheimer's point thusly: \"Insecure writers tend to reach for the thesaurus.\"Here are several recent examples from my own field of urban studies.I was recently asked to review a paper submitted to the Society for Existential and Phenomenological Theory and Culture for its upcoming annual conference at the University of Calgary in Canada. The paper was entitled \"Detroit: Sense of Place and Self-Overcoming,\" which I hoped would have something to do with the class and race struggles of the city's working class, which has suffered due to the decline of its auto industry and Michigan's increasingly right-wing and anti-union policies. Instead, here's how the author summarized his ideas:We build, maintain, and structure cities. Cities, however, maintain and structure certain attitudes in us. Given the attitudes generated by our sense of a place, critical perspectives that only target overt structures within city systems are incomplete. Jacobs outlines several design aspects of the city that are \"Anticity\u2026\" Hardt and Negri identify the task of the politics of the metropolis as \"\u2026to organize antagonisms against hierarchies and divisions of the metropolis\u2026\" To fully engage the attitudes generated by our sense of a place requires what Nietzsche describes as self-mastery. Though important factors, design and politics alone are insufficient.A prominent urban scholar at Harvard describes his latest research project as following:Through a conceptual distinction between concentrated urbanization (agglomeration) and extended urbanization (operational landscapes) \u2026 we aim to investigate the historical geographies of the capitalist urban-industrial fabric in ways that supersede inherited metageographical binarisms while opening up new sociological, cartographic and political perspectives on the contemporary global-urban condition.This same professor recently co-authored an article with two colleagues, published in a journal called City, which they summarized thusly:Theoretical, conceptual and methodological choices must be framed in relation to concrete explanatory and interpretive dilemmas, not ontological foundations. In engaging with the limits and possibilities of recent assemblage-based work in urban studies, our concern has been to help forge new analytical tools for deciphering emerging patterns of planetary urbanization, which have unsettled the coherence and viability of earlier intellectual frameworks. As urbanization is changing, so too must urban theory change, and it must do so in ways that provide critical purchase on emergent sociospatial divisions, conflicts, struggles and transformations at all spatial scales and across divergent places and territories. To this end, responding to several strands of the debate on assemblage urbanism that has unfolded in previous issues of City, here we clarify our meta-theoretical stance, address several methodological questions and reiterate our arguments regarding the importance of a reinvigorated geopolitical economy of planetary urbanization. We insist on the importance of abstraction as a necessary methodological moment in any reflexive approach to urban knowledge formation.Detroit and other American cities face enormous problems-poverty, homelessness, suburban sprawl, decaying infrastructure, underfunded schools, pollution, racial profiling by cops, and others. Professors and researchers who study and care about cities-and whose work is subsidized directly and indirectly (through foundation grants and government-sponsored financial aid to students) by tax dollars-have an obligation to help address these problems, in part by explaining the roots of the urban crisis and what's needed to address it. It is difficult to see how this kind of abstract theorizing and impenetrable prose contributes to improving our cities.I am sure that the other people who were on the \"Absence of Absences\" panel in Tokyo are serious scholars who care deeply about their research and can explain it in plain language if asked to do so. But as long as academics write primarily for tiny niches of other academics in language that obscures more than it enlightens, the general public will justifiably continue to question the value of higher education and whether their hard-earned tax dollars should be invested in the work of scholars who seem to have little interest in making their ideas accessible to the general public or useful to society.\n\n    \n    \n\n    ",

For the representation of deals in Lily, we used the fa-money icon. \u00a0The icon looks like a one dollar bill. Although I realise this might sound rather insignificant, it bothered me a lot because making a deal is not about receiving money. It\u2019s about entering a relationship that is beneficial to both parties. Besides that, the money icon gave me a \u201ccorky dorky core business\u201d feeling, which is just lame. The money icon didn\u2019t work very well aesthetically either. It\u2019s very hard to recognize the face of George Washington or the value of the money on an icon that is merely 18 by 18 pixels.\nNevertheless, the font-awesome library we use contains over 600 great icons, so I was pretty sure it would contain a handshake icon that would emphasize cooperation, agreement and (business) relationships. Unfortunately, I had to discover there was no handshake icon. And apparently I wasn\u2019t the only one looking for it. Since March 2013, a lot of people requested for a handshake icon on the Font Awesome GitHub repository.\nWhen I searched the internet I found many handshake icons but they were quite unsatisfactory. The white space between the fingers is clogging up with most of them. I then tried a few designs of my own. My first designs also had the same issues with the fingers clogging up. I wanted the icon to be as square as possible\u00a0so that the space was used optimally. I discovered during my first designs this was really difficult to achieve with two hands holding each other while maintaining some sort of symmetry.\n\nIcon design iterations (left to right) on various sizes 60px, 48px, 36px, 30px, 24px, 18px.\nWith this blog post, I like to offer my final design to icon designer @DaveGandy and like to invite him to add the handshake icon I\u2019ve designed to the Font Awesome icon set. I think it would make loads of people incredibly happy. For those who would like to use the icon already but can\u2019t wait until Dave and I shake hands (I\u2019m hoping he will reach out to me). The icon can be downloaded as a\u00a0.SVG or an Adobe Illustrator file. As with everything else we do, the end result is open sourced under Creative Commons licence (CC BY-SA 4.0). That means you can copy, clone, alter, and do anything with it you like.\n\nFinal designs for a fa-handshake icon\nDon\u2019t forget to follow me on twitter @lkhrtsm and @wearespindle. I\u2019m planning to release more awesome stuff in the near future. I always appreciate comments, let me know what you think and I will reply if you contact me.\n\n                \n\n\n                \n\n            ",
